```python
!pip install -Uqq nixtla
```



```python
from nixtla.utils import in_colab
```



```python
IN_COLAB = in_colab()
```



```python
if not IN_COLAB:
    from nixtla.utils import colab_badge
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
```


Fine-tuning is a powerful process for utilizing TimeGPT more
effectively. Foundation models such as TimeGPT are pre-trained on vast
amounts of data, capturing wide-ranging features and patterns. These
models can then be specialized for specific contexts or domains. With
fine-tuning, the model’s parameters are refined to forecast a new task,
allowing it to tailor its vast pre-existing knowledge towards the
requirements of the new data. Fine-tuning thus serves as a crucial
bridge, linking TimeGPT’s broad capabilities to your tasks
specificities.

Concretely, the process of fine-tuning consists of performing a certain
number of training iterations on your input data minimizing the
forecasting error. The forecasts will then be produced with the updated
model. To control the number of iterations, use the `finetune_steps`
argument of the `forecast` method.

## 1. Import packages

First, we import the required packages and initialize the Nixtla client

```python
import pandas as pd
from nixtla import NixtlaClient
from utilsforecast.losses import mae, mse
from utilsforecast.evaluation import evaluate
```


```python
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(
    # defaults to os.environ.get("NIXTLA_API_KEY")
    api_key = 'my_api_key_provided_by_nixtla'
)
```

> 👍 Use an Azure AI endpoint
>
> To use an Azure AI endpoint, remember to set also the `base_url`
> argument:
>
> `nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(base_url="you azure ai endpoint", api_key="your api_key")`


```python
if not IN_COLAB:
    nixtla_client = NixtlaClient()
```


## 2. Load data

```python
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/main/datasets/air_passengers.csv')
df.head()
```

|     | timestamp  | value |
|-----|------------|-------|
| 0   | 1949-01-01 | 112   |
| 1   | 1949-02-01 | 118   |
| 2   | 1949-03-01 | 132   |
| 3   | 1949-04-01 | 129   |
| 4   | 1949-05-01 | 121   |

## 3. Fine-tuning

Here, `finetune_steps=10` means the model will go through 10 iterations
of training on your time series data.

```python
timegpt_fcst_finetune_df = nixtla_client.forecast(
    df=df, h=12, finetune_steps=10,
    time_col='timestamp', target_col='value',
)
```

> 📘 Available models in Azure AI
>
> If you are using an Azure AI endpoint, please be sure to set

> `nixtla_client.forecast(..., model="azureai")`
>
> For the public API, we support two models: `timegpt-1` and
> `timegpt-1-long-horizon`.
>
> By default, `timegpt-1` is used. Please see [this
> tutorial](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-long_horizon_forecasting)
> on how and when to use `timegpt-1-long-horizon`.

```python
nixtla_client.plot(
    df, timegpt_fcst_finetune_df, 
    time_col='timestamp', target_col='value',
)
```

Keep in mind that fine-tuning can be a bit of trial and error. You might
need to adjust the number of `finetune_steps` based on your specific
needs and the complexity of your data. Usually, a larger value of
`finetune_steps` works better for large datasets.

It’s recommended to monitor the model’s performance during fine-tuning
and adjust as needed. Be aware that more `finetune_steps` may lead to
longer training times and could potentially lead to overfitting if not
managed properly.

Remember, fine-tuning is a powerful feature, but it should be used
thoughtfully and carefully.
