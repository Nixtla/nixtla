```python
!pip install -Uqq nixtla hierarchicalforecast
```



```python
from nixtla.utils import in_colab

In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use TimeGPT for temporal
hierarchical forecasting. We will use a dataset that has an hourly
frequency, and we create forecasts with TimeGPT for both the hourly and
the 2-hourly frequency level. The latter constitutes the timeseries when
it is aggregated across 2-hour windows. Subsequently, we can use
temporal reconciliation techniques to improve the forecasting
performance of TimeGPT.

## 2. Temporal aggregation

We are interested in generating forecasts for the hourly and 2-hourly
windows. We can generate these forecasts using TimeGPT. After generating
these forecasts, we make use of hierarchical forecasting techniques to
improve the accuracy of each forecast.

We first define the temporal aggregation spec. The spec is a dictionary
in which the keys are the name of the aggregation and the value is the
amount of bottom-level timesteps that should be aggregated in that
aggregation.

In this example, we choose a temporal aggregation of a 2-hour period and
a 1-hour period (the bottom level).

```python
spec_temporal = { "2-hour-period": 2, "1-hour-period": 1}
```

We next compute the temporally aggregated train- and test sets using the
`aggregate_temporal` function from `hierarchicalforecast`. Note that we
have different aggregation matrices `S` for the train- and test set, as
the test set contains temporal hierarchies that are not included in the
train set.

```python
from hierarchicalforecast.utils import aggregate_temporal
```


```python
Y_train, S_train, tags_train = aggregate_temporal(df=df_train[['unique_id','ds','y']], spec=spec_temporal)
Y_test, S_test, tags_test = aggregate_temporal(df=df_test[['unique_id','ds','y']],  spec=spec_temporal)
```

`Y_train` contains our training data, for both 1-hour and 2-hour
periods. For example, if we look at the first two timestamps of the
training data, we have a 2-hour period ending at 2017-10-22 01:00, and
two 1-hour periods, the first ending at 2017-10-22 00:00, and the second
at 2017-10-22 01:00, the latter corresponding to when the first 2-hour
period ends.

Also, the ground truth value `y` of the first 2-hour period is 38.13,
which is equal to the sum of the first two 1-hour periods (19.10 +
19.03). This showcases how the higher frequency `1-hour-period` has been
aggregated into the `2-hour-period` frequency.

```python
Y_train.query("ds <= '2017-10-22 01:00:00'")
```

|     | temporal_id     | unique_id | ds                  | y     |
|-----|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| 0   | 2-hour-period-1 | DE        | 2017-10-22 01:00:00 | 38.13 |
| 816 | 1-hour-period-1 | DE        | 2017-10-22 00:00:00 | 19.10 |
| 817 | 1-hour-period-2 | DE        | 2017-10-22 01:00:00 | 19.03 |

The aggregation matrices `S_train` and `S_test` detail how the lowest
temporal granularity (hour) can be aggregated into the 2-hour periods.
For example, the first 2-hour period, named `2-hour-period-1`, can be
constructed by summing the first two hour-periods, `1-hour-period-1` and
`1-hour-period-2` - which we also verified above in our inspection of
`Y_train`.

```python
S_train.iloc[:5, :5]
```

|     | temporal_id     | 1-hour-period-1 | 1-hour-period-2 | 1-hour-period-3 | 1-hour-period-4 |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 0   | 2-hour-period-1 | 1.0             | 1.0             | 0.0             | 0.0             |
| 1   | 2-hour-period-2 | 0.0             | 0.0             | 1.0             | 1.0             |
| 2   | 2-hour-period-3 | 0.0             | 0.0             | 0.0             | 0.0             |
| 3   | 2-hour-period-4 | 0.0             | 0.0             | 0.0             | 0.0             |
| 4   | 2-hour-period-5 | 0.0             | 0.0             | 0.0             | 0.0             |

### 3b. Computing base forecasts

Now, we need to compute base forecasts for each temporal aggregation.
The following cell computes the **base forecasts** for each temporal
aggregation in `Y_train` using TimeGPT.

Note that both frequency and horizon are different for each temporal
aggregation. In this example, the lowest level has a hourly frequency,
and a horizon of `48`. The `2-hourly-period` aggregation thus has a
2-hourly frequency with a horizon of `24`.

```python
Y_hats = []
id_cols = ["unique_id", "temporal_id", "ds", "y"]
# We will train a model for each temporal level
for level, temporal_ids_train in tags_train.items():
    # Filter the data for the level
    Y_level_train = Y_train.query("temporal_id in @temporal_ids_train")
    temporal_ids_test = tags_test[level]
    Y_level_test = Y_test.query("temporal_id in @temporal_ids_test")
    # For each temporal level we have a different frequency and forecast horizon
    freq_level = pd.infer_freq(Y_level_train["ds"].unique())
    horizon_level = Y_level_test["ds"].nunique()
    # Train a model and create forecasts
    Y_hat_level = nixtla_client.forecast(df=Y_level_train[["ds", "unique_id", "y"]], h=horizon_level)
    # Add the test set to the forecast
    Y_hat_level = Y_hat_level.merge(Y_level_test, on=["ds", "unique_id"], how="left")
    # Put cols in the right order (for readability)
    Y_hat_cols = id_cols + [col for col in Y_hat_level.columns if col not in id_cols]
    Y_hat_level = Y_hat_level[Y_hat_cols]
    # Append the forecast to the list
    Y_hats.append(Y_hat_level)

Y_hat = pd.concat(Y_hats, ignore_index=True)
```

Observe that `Y_hat` contains all the forecasts but they are not
coherent with each other. For example, consider the forecasts for the
first time period of both frequencies.

```python
Y_hat.query("temporal_id in ['2-hour-period-1', '1-hour-period-1', '1-hour-period-2']")
```

|     | unique_id | temporal_id     | ds                  | y     | TimeGPT   |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------|-----------|
| 0   | DE        | 2-hour-period-1 | 2017-12-29 01:00:00 | 10.45 | 16.949448 |
| 24  | DE        | 1-hour-period-1 | 2017-12-29 00:00:00 | 9.73  | -0.241489 |
| 25  | DE        | 1-hour-period-2 | 2017-12-29 01:00:00 | 0.72  | -3.456482 |

The ground truth value `y` for the first 2-hour period is 10.45, and the
sum of the ground truth values for the first two 1-hour periods is
(9.73 + 0.72) = 10.45. Hence, these values are coherent with each other.

However, the forecast for the first 2-hour period is 16.95, but the sum
of the forecasts for the first two 1-hour periods is -3.69. Hence, these
forecasts are clearly not coherent with each other.

We will use reconciliation techniques to make these forecasts better
coherent with each other and improve their accuracy.

### 3c. Reconcile forecasts

We can use the `HierarchicalReconciliation` class to reconcile the
forecasts. In this example we use `MinTrace`. Note that we have to set
`temporal=True` in the `reconcile` function.

```python
from hierarchicalforecast.methods import MinTrace
from hierarchicalforecast.core import HierarchicalReconciliation
```


```python
reconcilers = [
    MinTrace(method="wls_struct"),
]
hrec = HierarchicalReconciliation(reconcilers=reconcilers)
Y_rec = hrec.reconcile(Y_hat_df=Y_hat, S=S_test, tags=tags_test, temporal=True)
```

## 4. Evaluation

The `HierarchicalForecast` package includes the `evaluate` function to
evaluate the different hierarchies.

We evaluate the temporally aggregated forecasts *across all temporal
aggregations*.

```python
import hierarchicalforecast.evaluation as hfe
from utilsforecast.losses import mae
```


```python
evaluation = hfe.evaluate(df = Y_rec.drop(columns = 'unique_id'),
                      tags = tags_test,
                      metrics = [mae],
                      id_col='temporal_id')

numeric_cols = evaluation.select_dtypes(include="number").columns
evaluation[numeric_cols] = evaluation[numeric_cols].map('{:.3}'.format).astype(np.float64)
```


```python
evaluation
```

|     | level         | metric | TimeGPT | TimeGPT/MinTrace_method-wls_struct |
|-----|---------------|--------|---------|------------------------------------|
| 0   | 2-hour-period | mae    | 25.2    | 12.00                              |
| 1   | 1-hour-period | mae    | 18.5    | 6.16                               |
| 2   | Overall       | mae    | 20.8    | 8.12                               |

As we can see, we improved performance of TimeGPT’s predictions both for
the 2-hour period and for the 1-hour period, as both levels see a
significant reduction in MAE and RMSE.

Visually, we can also verify the forecast is better after using
reconciliation techniques. For the 1-hour-period forecasts:

```python
plot_series(Y_train.query("temporal_id in @tags_train['1-hour-period']")[["y", "ds", "unique_id"]].iloc[-100:], forecasts_df=Y_rec.query("temporal_id in @tags_test['1-hour-period']").drop(columns=["temporal_id"]))
```

![](23_temporalhierarchical_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-24-output-1.png)

and for the 2-hour period forecasts:

```python
plot_series(Y_train.query("temporal_id in @tags_train['2-hour-period']")[["y", "ds", "unique_id"]].iloc[-50:], forecasts_df=Y_rec.query("temporal_id in @tags_test['2-hour-period']").drop(columns=["temporal_id"]))
```

![](23_temporalhierarchical_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-25-output-1.png)

Also, we can now verify that the forecasts are better coherent with each
other. For the first 2-hour period, our forecast after reconciliation is
6.63, and the sum of the forecasts for the first two 1-hour periods is
1.7 + 4.92 = 6.63. Hence, we now have more accurate and coherent
forecasts across frequencies.

```python
Y_rec.query("temporal_id in ['2-hour-period-1', '1-hour-period-1', '1-hour-period-2']")
```

|     | unique_id | temporal_id     | ds                  | y     | TimeGPT   | TimeGPT/MinTrace_method-wls_struct |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| 0   | DE        | 2-hour-period-1 | 2017-12-29 01:00:00 | 10.45 | 16.949448 | 6.625738                           |
| 24  | DE        | 1-hour-period-1 | 2017-12-29 00:00:00 | 9.73  | -0.241489 | 4.920365                           |
| 25  | DE        | 1-hour-period-2 | 2017-12-29 01:00:00 | 0.72  | -3.456482 | 1.705373                           |

## Conclusion

In this notebook we have shown: - How to create forecasts for multiple
frequencies for the same dataset with TimeGPT - How to improve the
accuracy of these forecasts using temporal reconciliation techniques

Note that even though we created forecasts for two different frequencie,
there is no ‘need’ to use the forecast of the 2-hour-period. One can use
this technique also simply to improve the forecast of the 1-hour-period.
