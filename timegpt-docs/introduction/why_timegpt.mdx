## Why TimeGPT?

TimeGPT is a powerful, general-purpose time series forecasting solution. Throughout this notebook, we compare TimeGPT's performance against three popular forecasting approaches:

- Classical model (ARIMA)
- Machine learning model (LightGBM)
- Deep learning model (N-HiTS)


Below are three core benefits that our users value the most:

</CardGroup>

## TimeGPT Advantage

TimeGPT delivers **superior results with minimal effort** compared to traditional approaches. In head-to-head testing against ARIMA, LightGBM, and N-HiTS models on M5 competition data, TimeGPT consistently achieves better accuracy metrics (**lowest RMSE at 592.6** and **SMAPE at 4.94%**).

Unlike other models which require:

- _Extensive preprocessing_
- _Parameter tuning_
- _Significant computational resources_

TimeGPT provides **powerful forecasting capabilities** with a simple API interface, making advanced time series analysis **accessible to users of all technical backgrounds**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Data Introduction">
    This notebook uses an aggregated subset from the M5 Forecasting Accuracy competition. The dataset:

    - Consists of **7 daily time series**
    - Has **1,941 observations** per series
    - Reserves the last **28 observations** for evaluation on unseen data

    ```python Data Loading and Stats Preview
    import os
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    from nixtla import NixtlaClient
    from utilsforecast.plotting import plot_series
    from utilsforecast.losses import mae, rmse, smape
    from utilsforecast.evaluation import evaluate
    
    nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(
        # api_key='my_api_key_provided_by_nixtla'
    )
    
    df = pd.read_csv(
        'https://datasets-nixtla.s3.amazonaws.com/demand_example.csv',
        parse_dates=['ds']
    )
    
    # Display aggregated statistics per time series
    df.groupby('unique_id').agg({
        "ds": ["min", "max", "count"],
        "y": ["min", "mean", "median", "max"]
    })
    ```

    <Info>
      Below is a preview of the aggregated statistics for each of the 7 time series.
    </Info>
    | unique_id | min date   | max date   | count | min y | mean y   | median y | max y  |
    | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----- | ----- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
    | FOODS_1   | 2011-01-29 | 2016-05-22 | 1941  | 0.0   | 2674.086 | 2665.0   | 5493.0 |
    | FOODS_2   | 2011-01-29 | 2016-05-22 | 1941  | 0.0   | 4015.984 | 3894.0   | 9069.0 |
    | ...       | ...        | ...        | ...   | ...   | ...      | ...      | ...    |

    Next, we split our dataset into training and test sets. Here, we use data up to "2016-04-24" for training and the remaining data for testing.

    ```python Train-Test Split Example
    df_train = df.query('ds <= "2016-04-24"')
    df_test = df.query('ds > "2016-04-24"')
    
    print(df_train.shape, df_test.shape)
    # (13391, 3) (196, 3)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Model Fitting (TimeGPT, ARIMA, LightGBM, N-HiTS)">
    TimeGPT is compared against four different modeling approaches. Each approach forecasts the final 28 days of our dataset and we compare results across Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).

        <Info>
          TimeGPT offers a streamlined solution for time series forecasting with minimal setup.

      <Accordion title="2.2 Classical Models (ARIMA)">
        <Info>
          ARIMA is a common baseline for time series, though it often requires more data preprocessing and does not handle multiple series as efficiently.
        </Info>
        ```python ARIMA Forecasting Using StatsForecast
        from statsforecast import StatsForecast
        from statsforecast.models import AutoARIMA
        
        sf = StatsForecast(models=[AutoARIMA()], freq='D')
        fcst_arima = sf.forecast(h=28, df=df_train)
        # Evaluation methods omitted here for brevity
        ```
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="2.3 Machine Learning Models (LightGBM)">
        <Info>
          LightGBM is a popular gradient-boosted tree approach. However, careful feature engineering is typically required for optimal results.
        </Info>
        ```python LightGBM Modeling with AutoMLForecast
        import optuna
        from mlforecast.auto import AutoMLForecast, AutoLightGBM
        
        mlf = AutoMLForecast(models=[AutoLightGBM()], freq='D')
        mlf.fit(df_train)
        fcst_lgbm = mlf.predict(28)
        # Evaluation methods omitted here for brevity
        ```
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="2.4 N-HiTS">
        <Info>
          N-HiTS is a deep learning architecture for time series. While powerful, it often requires GPU resources and more hyperparameter tuning.
        </Info>
        ```python N-HiTS Deep Learning Forecast
        from neuralforecast.core import NeuralForecast
        from neuralforecast.models import NHITS
        
        nf = NeuralForecast(models=[NHITS()], freq='D')
        nf.fit(df=df_train)
        fcst_nhits = nf.predict()
        # Evaluation methods omitted here for brevity
