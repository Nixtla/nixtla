    "Nixtla's TimeGPT is a generative pre-trained forecasting model for time series data. TimeGPT can produce accurate forecasts for new time series without training, using only historical values as inputs. TimeGPT can be used across a plethora of tasks including demand forecasting, anomaly detection, financial forecasting, and more."

It looks at windows of past data, which we can think of as \"tokens\", and predicts what comes next. This prediction is based on patterns the model identifies in past data and extrapolates into the future."
