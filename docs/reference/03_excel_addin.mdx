### Data Requirements

-   Put your dates in one column and your values in another.
-   Ensure your date format is recognized as a valid date by excel.
-   Ensure your values are recognized as valid number by excel.
-   All data inputs must exist in the same worksheet. The add-in does
    not support forecasting using multiple worksheets.
-   Do not include headers

Example:

| dates         | values |
|:--------------|:-------|
| 12/1/16 0:00  | 72     |
| 12/1/16 1:00  | 65.8   |
| 12/1/16 2:00  | 59.99  |
| 12/1/16 3:00  | 50.69  |
| 12/1/16 4:00  | 52.58  |
| 12/1/16 5:00  | 65.05  |
| 12/1/16 6:00  | 80.4   |
| 12/1/16 7:00  | 200    |
| 12/1/16 8:00  | 200.63 |
| 12/1/16 9:00  | 155.47 |
| 12/1/16 10:00 | 150.91 |

#### Forecasting

Once you‚Äôve configured your token and formatted your input data then
you‚Äôre all ready to forecast!

With the add-in open, configure the forecasting settings by selecting
the column for each input.

-   **Frequency** - The frequency of the data (hourly / daily / weekly /
    monthly)

-   **Horizon** - The forecasting horizon. This represents the number of
    time steps into the future that the forecast should predict.

-   **Dates Range** - The column and range of the timeseries timestamps.
    Must not include header data, and should be formatted as a range,
    e.g.¬†A2:A145.

-   **Values Range** - The column and range of the timeseries values for
    each point in time. Must not include header data, and should be
    formatted as a range, e.g.¬†B2:B145.

When you‚Äôre ready, click **Make Prediction** to generate the predicted
values. The add-in will generate a plot and append the forecasted data
to the end of the column of your existing data and highlight them in
green. So, scroll to the end of your data to see the predicted values.

#### Anomaly Detection

The requirements are the same as for the forecasting functionality, so
if you already tried it you are ready to run the anomaly detection one.
Go to the main page in the add-in and select ‚ÄúAnomaly Detection‚Äù, then
choose your dates and values cell ranges and click on submit. We‚Äôll run
the model and mark the anomalies cells in yellow while adding a third
column for expected values with a green background.
