## Quick Start: General Training Steps

Below is a concise overview of how to start training with **TimeGPT**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Data">
    Ensure your time series data is clean, properly formatted, and includes all necessary features (e.g., timestamps, values, external variables).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Forecasting Approach">
    Decide whether you need a single series or multi-series approach, and whether you need short or long horizons.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure TimeGPT">
    Set up the relevant hyperparameters for your forecasting needs (window size, horizon, seasonalities, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Train and Evaluate">
    Train the model on your dataset and evaluate performance with appropriate error metrics (MAPE, RMSE, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine and Deploy">
    Use performance insights to refine your model, then deploy it in a production environment.
  </Step>

## Example Training Code

Below is a simplified example of how you might train **TimeGPT** in Python. Adjust hyperparameters as needed for your specific use case.

<CodeGroup>

```python Example: Training TimeGPT Multi-Series
# Example: Training TimeGPT for a multi-series scenario
import timegpt

# Load your dataset
data = timegpt.load_data("my_dataset.csv")

# Initialize the model
model = timegpt.TimeGPT(
    horizon=30,           # Forecast horizon
    max_epochs=50,        # Number of training epochs
    seasonality=24,       # Seasonal period
    learning_rate=1e-3
)

# Train the model
model.fit(data)

# Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(data)

# Evaluate results
error = model.evaluate(predictions, data)

print(f"Forecast error: {error:.2f}")
```
