## TimeGPT

What is TimeGPT?

`TimeGPT` is the first foundation model for time series forecasting. It
can produce accurate forecasts for new time series across a diverse
array of domains using only historical values as inputs. The model
“reads” time series data sequentially from left to right, similarly to
how humans read a sentence. It looks at windows of past data, which we
can think of as “tokens”, and then predicts what comes next. This
prediction is based on patterns the model identifies and that it
extrapolates into the future. Beyond forecasting, `TimeGPT` supports
other time series related tasks, such as what-if-scenarios, anomaly
detection, and more.

Is TimeGPT based on a Large Language Model (LLM)?

No, `TimeGPT` is not based on any large language model. While it follows
the same principle of training a large transformer model on a vast
dataset, its architecture is specifically designed to handle time series
data and it has been trained to minimize forecasting errors.

How do I get started with TimeGPT?

To get started with `TimeGPT`, you need to register for an account
[here](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/). You will receive an email asking
you to confirm your signup. After confirming, you will be able to access
your dashboard, which contains the details of your account.

How accessible is TimeGPT and what are the usage costs?

For a more in-depth understanding of `TimeGPT`, please refer to the
[research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03589.pdf). While certain
aspects of the model’s architecture remain confidential, registration
for `TimeGPT` is open to all. New users receive \$1,000 USD in free
credits and subsequent usage fees are based on token consumption. For
more details, please refer to the [Pricing and
Billing](#pricing-and-billing) section

How can I use TimeGPT?

-   Through the [Python SDK](https://github.com/Nixtla/nixtla)

-   Via the `TimeGPT` API. For instructions on how to call the API using
    different languages, please refer to the [API
    documentation](https://docs.nixtla.io/reference/timegpt_timegpt_post)

Both methods require you to have a [API key](#timegpt-api-key), which is
obtained upon registration and can be found in your dashboard under
`API Keys`.

## TimeGPT API Key

What is an API key?

An API key is a unique string of characters that serves as a key to
authenticate your requests when using the Nixtla SDK. It ensures that
the person making the requests is authorized to do so.

Where can I get an API key?

Upon registration, you will receive an API key that can be found in your
[dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/) under `API Keys`. Remember
that your API key is personal and should not be shared with anyone.

How do I use my API key?

To integrate your API key into your development workflow, please refer
to the tutorial on [Setting Up Your Authentication API
Key](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/setting_up_your_authentication_api_key).

How can I check the status of my API key?

If you want to check the status of your API key, you can use the
[`validate_api_key`
method](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/timegpt.html#timegpt-validate-api-key)
of the `NixtlaClient` class.

## Features and Capabilities

Can TimeGPT handle multiple time series?

Yes. For guidance on forecasting multiple time series at once, consult
the [Multiple
Series](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/docs/tutorials/multiple_series.html)
tutorial.

Does TimeGPT support forecasting with exogenous variables?

Yes. For instructions on how to incorporate exogenous variables to
`TimeGPT`, see the [Exogenous
Variables](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/docs/tutorials/exogenous_variables.html)
tutorial. For incorporating calendar dates specifically, you may find
the [Holidays and Special
Dates](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/holidays_and_special_dates) tutorial
useful.

Can TimeGPT be used for anomaly detection?

Yes. To learn how to use `TimeGPT` for anomaly detection, refer to the
[Anomaly
Detection](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/docs/tutorials/anomaly_detection.html)
tutorial.

Does TimeGPT support cross-validation?

Yes. To learn how to use `TimeGPT` for cross-validation, refer to the
[Cross-Validation](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/docs/tutorials/cross_validation.html)
tutorial.

Can TimeGPT be used to forecast historical data?

Yes. To find out how to forecast historical data using `TimeGPT`, see
the [Historical
Forecast](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/docs/tutorials/historical_forecast.html)
tutorial.

Can TimeGPT be used for uncertainty quantification?

Yes. For more information, explore the [Prediction
Intervals](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/prediction_intervals) and
[Quantile Forecasts](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/quantile_forecasts)
tutorials.

Can TimeGPT handle large datasets?

Yes. When dealing with large datasets that contain hundreds of thousands
or millions of time series, we recommend using a distributed backend.
`TimeGPT` is compatible with several distributed computing frameworks,
including
[Spark](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/how_to_on_spark_forecasting), Ray,
and Fugue. Both the `TimeGPT` SDK and API don’t have a limit on the size
of the dataset as long as a distributed backend is used.

Can TimeGPT be used with limited/short data?

`TimeGPT` requires at least two seasonal periods of the given frequency
to produce accurate forecasts. More may be needed for confidence
intervals and for fine-tuning. While `TimeGPT` can work with just one
observation, its accuracy will be limited.

What is the maximum forecast horizon allowed by TimeGPT?

While `TimeGPT` does not have a maximum forecast horizon, its
performance will decrease as the horizon increases. When the forecast
horizon exceeds the season length of the data (for example, more than 12
months for monthly data), you will get this message:
`WARNING:nixtla.nixtla_client:The specified horizon "h" exceeds the model horizon. This may lead to less accurate forecasts. Please consider using a smaller horizon`.

For details, refer to the tutorial on [Long Horizon in Time
Series](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/long_horizon_in_time_series).

Can TimeGPT handle missing values?

`TimeGPT` cannot handle missing values or series with irregular
timestamps. For more information, see the [Forecasting Time Series with
Irregular
Timestamps](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/docs/tutorials/irregular_timestamps.html)
tutorial.

How can I plot the TimeGPT forecast?

The `TimeGPT` class has a [`plot`
method](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/timegpt.html#timegpt-plot)
that can be used to visualize the forecast. This method only works in
interactive environments such as Jupyter notebooks and it doesn’t work
on Python scripts.

Does TimeGPT support polars?

As of now, `TimeGPT` supports only pandas DataFrames and does not offer
support for polars.

Does TimeGPT produce stable predictions?

`TimeGPT` is engineered for stability, ensuring consistent results for
identical input data. This means that given the same dataset, the model
will produce the same forecasts.

## Fine-tuning

What is fine-tuning?

`TimeGPT` was trained on the largest publicly available time series
dataset, covering a wide range of domains such as finance, retail,
healthcare, and more. This comprehensive training enables `TimeGPT` to
produce accurate forecasts for new time series without additional
training, a capability known as zero-shot learning.

While the zero-shot model provides a solid baseline, the performance of
`TimeGPT` can often be improved through fine-tuning. During this
process, the `TimeGPT` model undergoes additional training using your
specific dataset, starting from the pre-trained paramaters. The updated
model then produces the forecasts. You can control the number of
training iterations and the loss function for fine-tuning with the
`finetune_steps` and the `finetune_loss` parameters in the `forecast`
method from the `TimeGPT` class, respectively.

For a comprehensive guide on how to apply fine-tuning, please refer to
the [fine-tuning](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/finetuning) and the
[fine-tuning with a specific loss
function](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/fine_tuning_with_a_specific_loss_function)
tutorials.

Do I have to fine-tune every series?

No, you do not need to fine-tune every series individually. When using
the `finetune_steps` parameter, the model undergoes fine-tuning across
all series in your dataset simultaneously. This method uses a
cross-learning approach, allowing the model to learn from multiple
series at once, which can improve individual forecasts.

Keep in mind that selecting the right number of fine-tuning steps may
require some trial and error. As the number of fine-tuning steps
increases, the model becomes more specialized to your dataset, but will
take longer to train and may be more prone to overfitting.

Can I save fine-tuned parameters?

Currently, it is not possible to save the fine-tuned parameters for
later use. This means you will need to perform fine-tuning each time you
submit your data, whether using the Python SDK or the API.

## Pricing and Billing

How does pricing work?

`TimeGPT`’s cost is based on usage. Every call you make has a certain
number of input, output, and finetune tokens associated with it. Price
tiers are based on the number of tokens used, which you can find in your
[dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/) under `Billing`. The cost per
token decreases as you move up tiers, and you will pay the corresponding
price for each segment of tokens used.

Are there free credits or discounts?

Upon signing up, all users receive \$1000 USD in free credits. Once
these credits are exhausted, you will be asked to add a payment method
to continue using `TimeGPT`. Costs are then calculated based on the
number of tokens used and the applicable price tiers.

The pricing model is designed for production settings where pipelines
have already been tested and established. However, if you need
additional free credits for testing, or if you are using `TimeGPT` for
academic purposes, please contact us at ops@nixtla.io to ask about
eligibility for additional free credits or discounts.

Free credits do not expire and can be used at any time.

How are tokens counted?

One token corresponds to one row of your dataset. Please refer to
[TimeGPT
Quickstart](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/docs/getting-started/getting_started_short.html#usage)
and our tutorials to understand the data format required for each use
case. For high-frequency data, we recommend trimming the input whenever
possible. For example, when working with minute-level data, consider
trimming to the most recent hour to reduce costs.

In the `Usage` section of your
[dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/), you can find a detailed
record of your token consumption history, helping you track and manage
your usage effectively.

How does billing work?

Billing is done within the first five days of each month. We have
partnered with Stripe to handle all payment processing. You can view
your invoices and payment history in your
[dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/) under `Billing`.

## Troubleshooting

The following section contains some common errors and warnings

<strong>Error message: Invalid API key</strong>

```python
ApiError: status_code: 401, body: {'data': None, 'message': 'Invalid API key', 'details': 'Key not found', 'code': 'A12', 'requestID': 'E7F2BBTB2P', 'support': 'If you have questions or need support, please email ops@nixtla.io'}
```

**Solution:** This error occurs when your `TimeGPT` API key is either
invalid or has not been set up correctly. Please use the
`validate_api_key` method to verify it or make sure it was copied
correctly from the `API Keys` section of your
[dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/).

<strong>Error message: Too many requests</strong>

```python
ApiError: status_code: 429, body: {'data': None, 'message': 'Too many requests', 'details': 'You need to add a payment method to continue using the API, do so from https://dashboard.nixtla.io', 'code': 'A21', 'requestID': 'NCJDK7KSJ6', 'support': 'If you have questions or need support, please email ops@nixtla.io'}
```

**Solution:** This error occurs when you have exhausted your free
credits and need to add a payment method to continue using `TimeGPT`.
You can add a payment method in the `Billing` section of your
[dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/).

<strong>Error message: WriteTimeout</strong>

**Solution:** If you encounter a `WriteTimeout` error, it means that the
request has exceeded the allowable processing time. This is a common
issue when working with large datasets. To fix this, consider increasing
the `num_partitions` parameter in the [`forecast`
method](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/timegpt.html#timegpt-forecast)
of the TimeGPT class, or use a distributed backend if not already in
use.
