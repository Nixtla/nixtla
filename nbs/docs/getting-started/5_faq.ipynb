    "`TimeGPT` is the first foundation model for time series forecasting. It can produce accurate forecasts for new time series across a diverse array of domains using only historical values as inputs. The model \"reads\" time series data sequentially from left to right, similarly to how humans read a sentence. It looks at windows of past data, which we can think of as \"tokens\", and then predicts what comes next. This prediction is based on patterns the model identifies and that it extrapolates into the future. Beyond forecasting, `TimeGPT` supports other time series related tasks, such as what-if-scenarios, anomaly detection, and more. \n",
