title: Historical anomaly detection
---

This section provides various recipes for performing historical anomaly
detection using TimeGPT.

Historical anomaly detection identifies data points that deviate from
the expected behavior over a given historical time series, helping to
spot fraudulent activity, security breaches, or significant outliers.

The process involves generating predictions and constructing a 99%
confidence interval. Data points falling outside this interval are
considered anomalies.
