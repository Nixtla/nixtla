## Introduction

Forecasting time series is a ubiquitous task in finance, supporting decisions in trading, risk management, and strategic planning. Despite its prevalence, predicting the future prices of financial assets remains a formidable challenge, mainly due to the inherent volatility of financial markets.
For those who believe in the feasibility of forecasting these assets, or for professionals whose roles require such predictions, TimeGPT is a powerful tool that simplifies the forecasting process.

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use TimeGPT for financial time series forecasting, focusing on Bitcoin price prediction. We will also showcase how to use TimeGPT for uncertainty quantification, which is essential for risk management and decision-making.

### Why Forecast Bitcoin Prices

Bitcoin (₿) is the first decentralized digital currency and is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies. Transactions are managed and recorded on a public ledger known as the blockchain. Bitcoins are created as a reward for mining, a process that involves solving complex cryptographic tasks to verify transactions. This digital currency can be used as payment for goods and services, traded for other currencies, or held as a store of value.

Bitcoin's high volatility and widespread trading make accurate forecasting a valuable tool for financial analysis, trading strategies, and risk management.

## How to Use TimeGPT to Forecast Bitcoin Prices

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nixtla/nixtla/blob/main/nbs/docs/use-cases/2_bitcoin_price_prediction.ipynb)

### Step 1: Load Bitcoin Price Data

Bitcoin (₿) is the first decentralized digital currency, with transactions recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. Bitcoins are created through mining—solving cryptographic tasks—and are used for payments, trading, and long-term investment.

For convenience, we'll rename columns to match TimeGPT's expected `ds` (date) and `y` (target) format.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load Bitcoin historical price data from 2020-2023
df = pd.read_csv(
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/main/datasets/bitcoin_price_usd.csv',
    sep=','
)

df.head()
```

|   | Date       | Close        |
|---|------------|--------------|
| 0 | 2020-01-01 | 7200.174316  |
| 1 | 2020-01-02 | 6985.470215  |
| 2 | 2020-01-03 | 7344.884277  |
| 3 | 2020-01-04 | 7410.656738  |
| 4 | 2020-01-05 | 7411.317383  |

This dataset includes daily Bitcoin closing prices (in USD) from 2020-01-01 to 2023-12-31. While Bitcoin trades continuously, "closing price" here refers to a specific daily time rather than a traditional market close.

```python
# Rename columns to TimeGPT's expected format (ds=date, y=target value)
df.rename(columns={'Date': 'ds', 'Close': 'y'}, inplace=True)
```


### Step 2: Get Started with TimeGPT

Initialize the `NixtlaClient` with your Nixtla API key. To learn more about how to set up your API key, see [Setting up your API key](/setup/setting_up_your_api_key).


```python
from nixtla import NixtlaClient

# Initialize TimeGPT client with your API key
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(
    api_key='my_api_key_provided_by_nixtla'
)
```


### Step 3: Visualize the Data

Before attempting any forecasting, it is good practice to visualize the data we want to predict. The `NixtlaClient` class includes a `plot` method for this purpose.

The `plot` method has an `engine` argument that allows you to choose between different plotting libraries. Default is `matplotlib`, but you can also use `plotly` for interactive plots.

```python
# Visualize Bitcoin price history
nixtla_client.plot(df)
```

<Frame caption="Bitcoin Price Data">
  ![Bitcoin Price Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/nixtla/readme_docs/nbs/_docs/docs/use-cases/2_bitcoin_price_prediction_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-12-output-1.png)
</Frame>

If you did not rename the columns, specify them explicitly:

```python
nixtla_client.plot(
    df,
    time_col='Date Column',
    target_col='Close Column'
)
```


### Step 4: Forecast with TimeGPT

Now we are ready to generate predictions with TimeGPT. To do this, we will use the `forecast` method from the `NixtlaClient` class.

The `forecast` method requires the following arguments:

- `df`: The DataFrame containing the time series data
- `h`: (int) The forecast horizon. In this case, we will forecast the next 7 days. 
- `level`: (list) The confidence level for the prediction intervals. Given the inherent volatility of Bitcoin, we will use multiple confidence levels.

```python
# Generate 7-day forecast with 50%, 80%, and 90% prediction intervals
level = [50, 80, 90]

fcst = nixtla_client.forecast(
    df,
    h=7,  # Forecast horizon: 7 days
    level=level  # Confidence intervals for uncertainty quantification
)

fcst.head()
```

|   | ds         | TimeGPT      | TimeGPT-lo-90 | TimeGPT-lo-80 | TimeGPT-lo-50 | TimeGPT-hi-50 | TimeGPT-hi-80 | TimeGPT-hi-90 |
|---|------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 0 | 2024-01-01 | 42269.460938 | 39567.209020  | 40429.953636  | 41380.654646  | 43158.267229  | 44108.968239  | 44971.712855  |
| 1 | 2024-01-02 | 42469.917969 | 39697.941669  | 40578.197049  | 41466.511361  | 43473.324576  | 44361.638888  | 45241.894268  |
| 2 | 2024-01-03 | 42864.078125 | 40538.871243  | 41586.252507  | 42284.316674  | 43443.839576  | 44141.903743  | 45189.285007  |
| 3 | 2024-01-04 | 42881.621094 | 40603.117448  | 41216.106493  | 42058.539392  | 43704.702795  | 44547.135694  | 45160.124739  |
| 4 | 2024-01-05 | 42773.457031 | 40213.699760  | 40665.384780  | 41489.812431  | 44057.101632  | 44881.529282  | 45333.214302  |

We can pass the forecasts we just generated to the `plot` method to visualize the predictions with the historical data.

```python
# Plot historical data with forecast and confidence intervals
nixtla_client.plot(df, fcst, level=level)
```

</Frame>

To get a closer look at the predictions, we can zoom in on the plot or specify the maximum number of in-sample observations to be plotted using the `max_insample_length` argument. Note that setting `max_insample_length=60`, for instance, will display the last 60 historical values along with the complete forecast.

</Frame>


### Step 5: Extend Bitcoin Price Analysis with TimeGPT

#### Anomaly Detection

Given the volatility of the price of Bitcoin, it can be useful to try to identify anomalies in the data. TimeGPT can be used for this by calling the `detect_anomalies` method from the `NixtlaClient` class. This method evaluates each observation against its context within the series, using statistical measures to determine its likelihood of being an anomaly. By default, it identifies anomalies based on a 99 percent prediction interval. To change this, you can specify the `level` argument.

```python
# Detect anomalies in Bitcoin price data
anomalies_df = nixtla_client.detect_anomalies(df)

# Visualize anomalies highlighted on the price chart
nixtla_client.plot(
  df,
  anomalies_df,
  plot_anomalies=True
)
```

</Frame>

To learn how to incorporate exogenous variables to TimeGPT, see [Real-time Anomaly Detection](/anomaly_detection/real-time/introduction).


#### Add Exogenous Variables

If you have additional information that you believe could help improve the forecast, consider including it as an exogenous variable. For instance, you might add data such as the price of other cryptocurrencies, proprietary information, stock market indices, or the number of transactions in the Bitcoin network.

TimeGPT supports the incorporation of exogenous variables in the `forecast` method. However, keep in mind that you'll need to know the future values of these variables.

To learn how to incorporate exogenous variables to TimeGPT, see [Numeric Features Guide](/forecasting/exogenous-variables/numeric_features).


### Step 7: Understand the Model Limitations

As stated in the introduction, predicting the future prices of financial assets is a challenging task, especially for assets like Bitcoin. The predictions in this tutorial may appear accurate, mainly because they align with recent historical data and the model updates with new values at short intervals, avoiding significant deviations. However, the true challenge lies in forecasting Bitcoin's price for the upcoming days, not just its historical performance. For those who need or want to try to forecast these assets, `TimeGPT` can be an option that simplifies the forecasting process. With just a couple of lines of code, `TimeGPT` can help you: 

- Produce point forecasts 
- Quantify the uncertainty of your predictions 
- Produce in-sample forecasts 
- Detect anomalies 
- Incorporate exogenous variables
