  <Tab title="TimeGPT" icon="chart-line">
    <Accordion title="What is TimeGPT?">
      <img src="images/docs/Nixtla/nixtla/blob/main/nbs/img/timegpt_archi.png" alt="TimeGPT Concept" className="rounded-lg" width="300" style={{ float: 'right', margin: '0 0 20px 20px' }} />

      TimeGPT is the first foundation model for time series forecasting. It produces accurate forecasts for new time series across diverse domains using only historical values as inputs. The model reads time series data sequentially from left to right, similar to how humans read a sentence. It examines windows of past data as "tokens" and predicts what comes next based on identified patterns that extrapolate into the future. Beyond forecasting, TimeGPT supports other time series tasks, including what-if scenarios and anomaly detection.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Is TimeGPT based on a Large Language Model (LLM)?">
      <Check>
        TimeGPT is specifically designed for time series data, not text.
      </Check>

      No, TimeGPT is not based on any large language model. While it follows the principle of training a large transformer model on a vast dataset, its architecture specifically handles time series data and minimizes forecasting errors.

    <Accordion title="How can I check the status of my API key?">
      Check your API key status with the [`validate_api_key` method](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient-validate-api-key) of the `NixtlaClient` class.

      ```python Validate API Key Example
      from nixtla import NixtlaClient

      nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(api_key='my_api_key_provided_by_nixtla')
      nixtla_client.validate_api_key()
      ```

      ```bash Log Output
      INFO:nixtla.nixtla_client:Happy Forecasting! :), If you have questions or need support, please email support@nixtla.io

      True
      ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What if my API key isn't validating?">
      When you validate your API key and it returns `False`:
      * If you are targeting an Azure endpoint, getting `False` from the `NixtlaClient.validate_api_key` method is expected. You can skip this step when targeting an Azure endpoint and proceed diretly to forecasting instead.
      * If you are not taregting an Azure endpoint, then you should check the following:
        * Make sure you are using the latest version of the SDK (Python or R).
        * Check that your API key is active in your dashboard by visiting https://dashboard.nixtla.io/.
        * Consider any firewalls your organization might have. There may be restricted access. If so, you can whitelist our endpoint https://api.nixtla.io/.
          * To use Nixtla's API, you need to let your system know that our endpoint is ok, so it will let you access it. Whitelisting the endpoint isn't something that Nixtla can do on our side. It's something that needs to be done on the user's system. This is a bit of an [overview on whitelisting](https://www.csoonline.com/article/569493/whitelisting-explained-how-it-works-and-where-it-fits-in-a-security-program.html).
          * If you work in an organization, please work with an IT team. They're likely the ones setting the security and you can talk with them to get it addressed. If you run your own systems, then it's something you should be able to update, depending on the system you're using.

    <Accordion title="How can I plot the TimeGPT forecast?">
      The `NixtlaClient` class has a [`plot` method](/reference/sdk_reference#nixtlaclient-plot) for visualizing forecasts. This method works only in interactive environments such as Jupyter notebooks, not in Python scripts.

      <CodeGroup>
        <CodeBlock title="Plotting Forecast Example" icon="image">
          ```python Plotting Forecast Example
          # Plot forecast
          client.plot(
              historical_data=df,
              forecast_data=forecast,
              level=[80, 95]  # Optional: show prediction intervals

    <Accordion title="Does TimeGPT support polars?">
      Currently, TimeGPT does not support polars.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Does TimeGPT produce stable predictions?">
      <Check>
        Yes, TimeGPT produces consistent results for identical inputs.
      </Check>

      TimeGPT is engineered for stability, ensuring consistent results for identical input data. Given the same dataset, the model will produce the same forecasts.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can TimeGPT forecast data with simple pattern such as a straight line or sine wave?">
      While not the primary use case for TimeGPT, it can generate solid results on simple data patterns like straight lines. Zero-shot predictions might not always meet expectations, but fine-tuning allows TimeGPT to quickly grasp trends and produce accurate forecasts. For more details, refer to the [Improve Forecast Accuracy with TimeGPT](/forecasting/improve_accuracy) tutorial.

  <Tab title="Fine-tuning" icon="sliders">
    <Accordion title="What is fine-tuning?">
      <Check>
        Fine-tuning improves TimeGPT's performance for your specific data patterns.
      </Check>

      TimeGPT was trained on the largest publicly available time series dataset, covering domains including finance, retail, healthcare, and more. This comprehensive training enables TimeGPT to produce accurate forecasts for new time series without additional training (zero-shot learning).

      While the zero-shot model provides a solid baseline, TimeGPT performance often improves through fine-tuning. During this process, the TimeGPT model undergoes additional training using your specific dataset, starting from the pre-trained parameters.

        <CodeBlock title="Fine-tuning Usage Example" icon="wrench">
          ```python Fine-tuning Example
          # Fine-tune with 100 steps
          forecast = client.forecast(
              df,
              h=7,
              finetune_steps=100,
              finetune_loss="mse"  # Mean Squared Error
          )
          ```

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Do I have to fine-tune every series?">
      No, you do not need to fine-tune every series individually. When using the `finetune_steps` parameter, the model fine-tunes across all series in your dataset simultaneously. This cross-learning approach allows the model to learn from multiple series at once, which can improve individual forecasts.

      <Info>
        Selecting the right number of fine-tuning steps may require experimentation. As fine-tuning steps increase, the model becomes more specialized to your dataset but takes longer to train and may become more prone to overfitting.
      </Info>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I save fine-tuned parameters?">
      <Check>
        Yes, you can save and reuse fine-tuned models.
      </Check>

      You can fine-tune the TimeGPT model, save it, and reuse it later. For detailed instructions, see our guide on [Re-using Fine-tuned Models](/forecasting/fine-tuning/save_reuse_delete_finetuned_models).
