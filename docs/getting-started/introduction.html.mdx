guide](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/getting-started-timegpt_quickstart),
walk through tutorials on the different capabilities, and learn from
real-world use cases in our documentation.**

## Architecture

Self-attention, the revolutionary concept introduced by the paper
[Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), is the
basis of this foundation model. TimeGPT model is not based on any
existing large language model(LLM). Instead, it is independently trained
on a vast amount of time series data, and the large transformer model is
designed to minimize the forecasting error.

The architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure with multiple
layers, each with residual connections and layer normalization. Finally,
a linear layer maps the decoder’s output to the forecasting window
dimension. The general intuition is that attention-based mechanisms are
able to capture the diversity of past events and correctly extrapolate
potential future distributions.

To make prediction, TimeGPT “reads” the input series much like the way
humans read a sentence – from left to right. It looks at windows of past
data, which we can think of as “tokens”, and predicts what comes next.
This prediction is based on patterns the model identifies in past data
and extrapolates into the future.
