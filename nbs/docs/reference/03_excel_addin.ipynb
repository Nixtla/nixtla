    "\n",
    "* All data inputs must exist in the same worksheet. The add-in does not support forecasting using multiple worksheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time series and exogenous variables (optional) must exist in their own columns. Values that you want predicted can be left blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Headers are optional.\n",

    "* **Values** - The column of the timeseries values for each point in time\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exogenous Variable(s)** - The exogenous variables for each point in time. This should also include forecasting horizon (fh) additional timestamps to calculate the future values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Frequency** - The frequency of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Frequency Horizon** - The forecasting horizon. This represents the number of time steps into the future that the forecast should predict. This is usually the number of empty cells in the value column.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Finetune Steps (advanced)** - The number of tuning steps used to train the large time model on the data. Set this value to 0 for zero-shot inference, i.e., to make predictions without any further model tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're ready, click Run Forecast to generate the predicted values. The add-in will generate a new worksheet with the prediced values and a chart depicting the forecast."
