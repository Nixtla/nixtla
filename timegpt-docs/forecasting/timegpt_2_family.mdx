## TimeGPT-2 Family of Foundation Models

[TimeGPT-2](https://www.nixtla.io/blog/timegpt-2-announcement) and [TimeGPT-2.1](https://www.nixtla.io/blog/timegpt-2-1-announcement) are the latest versions of our enterprise-grade models, built to reliably solve mission-critical time-series problems. The TimeGPT-2 family of models is optimized for enterprise needs, prioritizing accuracy and stability with a privacy-first approach and full support for self-hosted and on-premises deployments.


## Set Up TimeGPT-2 family of models for Python Time Series Forecasting

### Step 1: Confirm Access and get an API Key

- Confirm with support@nixtla.io that your account has access to these latest models.
- Get your API key from [dashboard.nixtla.io](https://dashboard.nixtla.io). Note that you can also use your existing keys as long as your account has access to these latest models (Step 1 above).
  - Sign in using Google, GitHub, or your email.
  - Navigate to **API Keys** in the menu and select **Create New API Key**.
  - Your new API key will appear on the screen. Copy this key and save it in a safe place for use later.

### Step 2: Install Nixtla

Install the Nixtla library in your preferred Python environment. In order to use the TimeGPT-2 family of models, the client version must be >= 0.7.0.

```bash
pip install nixtla>=0.7.0
```

You can verify the client version installed using the following code. It should return a version >= 0.7.0

```python
from nixtla import __version__
__version__
```

```bash
0.7.2
```

### Step 3: Import the Nixtla TimeGPT client

Import the Nixtla client and instantiate it with your API key and base URL for TimeGPT-2 family:

```python
from nixtla import NixtlaClient

nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(
    base_url = 'https://api-preview.nixtla.io',  # Needed for TimeGPT-2 family
    api_key='my_api_key_provided_by_nixtla'
)
```

Verify the status and validity of your API key:

```python
nixtla_client.validate_api_key()
```

```bash
True
```

## Forecasting with TimeGPT-2 family

### Load your time series data

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/main/datasets/air_passengers.csv')
df.head()
```

|   | timestamp  | value |
| --- | ---------- | ----- |
| 0 | 1949-01-01 | 112   |
| 1 | 1949-02-01 | 118   |
| 2 | 1949-03-01 | 132   |
| 3 | 1949-04-01 | 129   |
| 4 | 1949-05-01 | 121   |


### Generate the forecast

Forecast the next 12 months using the SDK's `forecast` method. You can switch the model to any of the TimeGPT-2 family of models - `timegpt-2-pro`, `timegpt-2-lab`, `timegpt-2-mini`, `timegpt-2.1`

```python
timegpt_fcst_df = nixtla_client.forecast(
    df,
    h=12,
    time_col="timestamp",
    target_col="value",
    model="timegpt-2.1",
)
```

### Plot the forecast:

```python
nixtla_client.plot(df, timegpt_fcst_df, time_col='timestamp', target_col='value')
```
