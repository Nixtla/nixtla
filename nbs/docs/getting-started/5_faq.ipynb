    "`TimeGPT` is the first foundation model for time series forecasting. It can produce accurate forecasts for new time series across a diverse array of domains using only historical values as inputs. The model \"reads\" time series data sequentially from left to right, similarly to how humans read a sentence. It looks at windows of past data, which we can think of as \"tokens\", and then predicts what comes next. This prediction is based on patterns the model identifies and that it extrapolates into the future. Beyond forecasting, `TimeGPT` supports other time series related tasks, such as what-if-scenarios, anomaly detection, and more. \n",

In the [Exogenous Variables](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-exogenous_variables) tutorial, the hourly electricity price dataset has 8,400 rows. Since it contains 9 exogenous variables, this totals 84,000 tokens (8,400 rows x 10 columns, including the target).

    "1. If you do not set `num_partitions`, all calls to perform [anomaly detection](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/capabilities-anomaly-detection-quickstart) increase the usage by 1. Note that addition of [exogenous variables](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/capabilities-anomaly-detection-add_exogenous_variables) does not increase the usage further.\n",
    "2. If the API call requires to send more than 200MB of data, the API will return an error and will require you to use the `num_partitions` parameter in order to partition your request. Every partition will count as an API call, hence the usage will increase by the value you set for `num_partitions` (e.g. for num_partitions=2, the usage will increase by 2).\n",
