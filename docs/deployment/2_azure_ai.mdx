## Deploying TimeGEN-1

## Using the model

Once your model is deployed and provided that you have the relevant
permissions, consuming it will basically be the same process as for a
Nixtla endpoint.

To run the examples below, you will need to define the following
environment variables:

-   `AZURE_AI_NIXTLA_BASE_URL` is your api URL, should be of the form
    `https://your-endpoint.inference.ai.azure.com/`.
-   `AZURE_AI_NIXTLA_API_KEY` is your authentication key.

## How to use

Just import the library, set your credentials, and start forecasting in
two lines of code!

```bash
pip install nixtla
```


```python
import os
from nixtla import NixtlaClient

base_url = os.environ["AZURE_AI_NIXTLA_BASE_URL"]
api_key = os.environ["AZURE_AI_NIXTLA_API_KEY"]
model = "azureai"

nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(api_key=api_key, base_url=base_url)
nixtla_client.forecast(
    ...,
    model=model,
)
```
