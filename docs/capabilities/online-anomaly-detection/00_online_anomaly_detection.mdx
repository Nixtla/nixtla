title: Online (Real-Time) Anomaly Detection
---

Online anomaly detection dynamically identifies anomalies as data
streams in, allowing users to specify the number of timestamps to
monitor. This method is well-suited for immediate applications, such as
fraud detection, live sensor monitoring, or tracking real-time demand
changes. By focusing on recent data and continuously generating
forecasts, it enables timely responses to anomalies in critical
scenarios.

This section provides various recipes for performing real-time anomaly
detection using TimeGPT, offering users the ability to detect outliers
and unusual patterns as they emerge, ensuring prompt intervention in
time-sensitive situations.
