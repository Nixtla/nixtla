<Accordion title="Time Series">
## Time Series

A time series is a sequence of numerical data points arranged in chronological order. In the context of TimeGPT, each data point in the series serves as input to the model. The model learns from patterns in the data and uses this understanding to forecast future values. Time series data appear in various domains, such as stock prices, weather recordings, and sales figures.

<Accordion title="Forecasting">
## Forecasting

Forecasting is a method used in many fields—such as business and environmental studies—to predict future outcomes based on historical information. It involves analyzing past data to detect patterns, trends, or recurring behaviors and extending these insights into the future.

<Info>
One significant advancement in forecasting is the application of modern machine-learning methods, including deep learning. Models like TimeGPT can handle large datasets and identify complex patterns with enhanced prediction accuracy.
</Info>

For example, a retailer might analyze past sales to forecast product demand, while an economist uses historical data to anticipate future economic conditions. TimeGPT makes these advanced capabilities accessible even to users without in-depth machine-learning expertise.

<Accordion title="Anomaly Detection">
## Anomaly Detection

Analyzing sequential data often requires identifying anomalies or unexpected events that deviate from standard patterns. TimeGPT supports anomaly detection by monitoring data sequences (such as daily temperatures) for unusual fluctuations.

<Warning>
Detecting anomalies is crucial for timely responses. Sudden changes in market behavior, unusual network activity, or abnormal sensor readings can all indicate a need for prompt investigation.
</Warning>

For example, in finance, TimeGPT can highlight abrupt market changes; in cybersecurity, it helps uncover suspicious network activity. Anomaly detection enhances forecasting by flagging significant outliers, improving overall data insights.

<Accordion title="Multiple Series">
## Multiple Series

TimeGPT provides robust support for multi-series forecasting, allowing simultaneous analysis of multiple time series. Users can train the model on many related series, improving accuracy and enabling more flexible customization for specific forecasting requirements.

<Accordion title="TimeGPT">
## TimeGPT

TimeGPT by Nixtla is a generative pre-trained model specifically designed for time series forecasting. It reviews historical series values (and optional exogenous variables) to generate predictions. Beyond forecasting, TimeGPT enables tasks like anomaly detection and financial forecasts.

<Info>
TimeGPT scans time series data similarly to how a person might read text: sequentially, from left to right. It can interpret historical windows (tokens) and leverage temporal patterns learned from billions of data points.
</Info>

With the TimeGPT API, you can access these forecasting capabilities for various potential use cases—from scenario planning to anomaly detection and beyond.
