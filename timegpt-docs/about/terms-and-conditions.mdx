# 3. Content

**(a) Your Content**. You may provide input to the Services ("**Input**"), and receive output generated and returned by the Services based on the Input ("**Output**"). Input and Output are collectively ("**Content**"). As between the parties and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you own all Input.

You are responsible for Content, including for ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or these Terms.

We may use Content from Services other than our API ("**Non-API Content**") to help develop and improve our Services.

If you do not want your Content used to improve Services, you can opt-out by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/rvF58qkNCt2uNjSX8).

# 4. Fees and Payments

**(a) Fees and Billing**. You will pay all fees charged to your account ("**Fees**") according to the prices and terms on the applicable pricing page, or as otherwise agreed between us in writing. We have the right to correct pricing errors or mistakes even if we have already issued an invoice or received payment. You will provide complete and accurate billing information including a valid and authorized payment method. We will charge your payment method on an agreed-upon periodic basis, but may reasonably change the date on which the charge is posted. You authorize Nixtla and its affiliates, and our third-party payment processor(s), to charge your payment method for the Fees.

If your payment cannot be completed, we will provide you written notice and may suspend access to the Services until payment is received. Fees are payable in U.S. dollars and are due upon invoice issuance. Payments are nonrefundable except as provided in this Agreement.

**(b) Taxes**. Unless otherwise stated, Fees do not include federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, duties, and other similar assessments ("**Taxes**"). You are responsible for all Taxes associated with your purchase, excluding Taxes based on our net income, and we may invoice you for such Taxes. You agree to timely pay such Taxes and provide us with documentation showing the payment, or additional evidence that we may reasonably require. Nixtla uses the name and address in your account registration as the place of supply for tax purposes, so you must keep this information accurate and up-to-date.

**(c) Price Changes**. We may change our prices by posting notice to your account and/or to our website. Price increases will be effective 14 days after they are posted, except for increases made for legal reasons or increases made to Beta Services, which will be effective immediately. Any price changes will apply to the Fees charged to your account immediately after the effective date of the changes.

**(d) Disputes and Late Payments**. If you want to dispute any Fees or Taxes, please contact [support@nixtla.io](mailto:support@nixtla.io) within thirty (30) days of the date of the disputed invoice. Undisputed amounts past due may be subject to a finance charge of 1.5% of the unpaid balance per month. If any amount of your Fees are past due, we may suspend your access to the Services after we provide you written notice of late payment.

**(e) Free Tier**. You may not create more than one account to benefit from credits provided in the free tier of the Services. If we believe you are not using the free tier in good faith, we may charge you standard fees or stop providing access to the Services.

# 5. Confidentiality, Security and Data Protection

**(a) Confidentiality**. You may be given access to Confidential Information of Nixtla, its affiliates and other third parties. You may use Confidential Information only as needed to use the Services as permitted under these Terms.

You may not disclose Confidential Information to any third party, and you will protect Confidential Information in the same manner that you protect your own confidential information of a similar nature, using at least reasonable care. Confidential Information means nonpublic information that Nixtla or its affiliates or third parties designate as confidential or should reasonably be considered confidential under the circumstances, including software, specifications, and other nonpublic business information.

Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault of yours; (ii) you already possess without any confidentiality obligations when you received it under these Terms; (iii) is rightfully disclosed to you by a third party without any confidentiality obligations; or (iv) you independently developed without using Confidential Information. You may disclose Confidential Information when required by law or the valid order of a court or other governmental authority if you give reasonable prior written notice to Nixtla and use reasonable efforts to limit the scope of disclosure, including assisting us with challenging the disclosure requirement, in each case where possible.

**(b) Security**. You must implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help secure your access to and use of the Services. If you discover any vulnerabilities or breaches related to your use of the Services, you must promptly contact Nixtla and provide details of the vulnerability or breach.

**(c) Processing of Personal Data**. If you use the Services to process personal data, you must provide legally adequate privacy notices and obtain necessary consents for the processing of such data, and you represent to us that you are processing such data in accordance with applicable law.

# 6. Term and Termination

**(a) Termination; Suspension**. These Terms take effect when you first use the Services and remain in effect until terminated. You may terminate these Terms at any time for any reason by discontinuing the use of the Services and Content.

We may terminate these Terms for any reason by providing you at least 30 days' advance notice. We may terminate these Terms immediately upon notice to you if you materially breach Sections 2 (Usage Requirements), 5 (Confidentiality, Security and Data Protection), 8 (Dispute Resolution) or 9 (General Terms), if there are changes in relationships with third-party technology providers outside of our control, or to comply with law or government requests. We may suspend your access to the Services if you do not comply with these Terms, if your use poses a security risk to us or any third party, or if we suspect that your use is fraudulent or could subject us or any third party to liability.

**(b) Effect on Termination**. Upon termination, you will stop using the Services and you will promptly return or, if instructed by us, destroy any Confidential Information. The sections of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination or expiration should survive, including but not limited to Sections 3 and 5-9.

# 7. Indemnification; Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitations on Liability

**(a) Indemnity**. You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our personnel, from and against any claims, losses, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to your use of the Services, including your Content, products or services you develop or offer in connection with the Services, and your breach of these Terms or violation of applicable law.

THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

# 8. Dispute Resolution

YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS:

**(a) MANDATORY ARBITRATION**. You and Nixtla agree to resolve any past or present claims relating to these Terms or our Services through final and binding arbitration, except that you have the right to opt out of these arbitration terms, and future changes to these arbitration terms, by emailing [support@nixtla.io](mailto:support@nixtla.io) within 30 days of agreeing to these arbitration terms or the relevant changes.

**(b) Informal Dispute Resolution**. We would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal legal action. Before filing a claim against Nixtla, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us notice at [support@nixtla.io](mailto:support@nixtla.io) of your name, a description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within 60 days, you may bring a formal proceeding. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during the 60-day resolution process. If you reside in the EU, the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access at [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr).

**(c) Arbitration Forum**. Either party may commence binding arbitration through ADR Services, an alternative dispute resolution provider. The parties will pay equal shares of the arbitration fees. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the arbitration fees and cannot obtain a waiver, Nixtla will pay them for you. Nixtla will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.

**(d) Arbitration Procedures**. The arbitration will be conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, via video conference, or in person in San Francisco, California, or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator by ADR Services under its then-prevailing rules. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except a California court has the authority to determine (i) the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 8, including the mass filing procedures below, and (ii) whether you have complied with the pre-arbitration requirements in this section. The amount of any settlement offer will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, if any.

**(e). Exceptions**. This arbitration section does not require arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property infringement.

**(f) NO CLASS ACTIONS**. Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim. This does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

**(g) Mass Filings**. If, at any time, 30 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against Nixtla or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities ("**Mass Filing**"), ADR Services will randomly assign sequential numbers to each of the Mass Filings. Claims numbered 1-10 will be the "Initial Test Cases" and will proceed to arbitration first. The arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference, unless the claims are resolved in advance or the parties agree to extend the deadline. The parties will then have 90 days (the "**Mediation Period**") to resolve the remaining cases in mediation based on the awards from the Initial Test Cases. If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during this time, the parties may choose to opt out of the arbitration process and proceed in court by providing written notice to the other party within 60 days after the Mediation Period. Otherwise, the remaining cases will be arbitrated in their assigned order. Any statute of limitations will be tolled from the time the Initial Test Cases are chosen until your case is chosen as described above.

**(h) Severability**. If any part of this Section 8 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow Mass Filing or class or representative arbitration, this Section 8 will be unenforceable in its entirety. Nothing in this section will be deemed to waive or otherwise limit the right to seek public injunctive relief or any other non-waivable right, pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from the arbitrator.

# 9. General Terms

**(a) Relationship of the Parties**. These Terms do not create a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between you and Nixtla or any of Nixtla's affiliates. Nixtla and you are independent contractors and neither party will have the power to bind the other or to incur obligations on the other's behalf without the other party's prior written consent.

Those changes will become effective no sooner than 30 days after we notify you. All other changes will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Services after any change means you agree to such change.

**(g) Notices**. All notices will be in writing. We may notify you using the registration information you provided or the email address associated with your use of the Services. Service will be deemed given on the date of receipt if delivered by email or on the date sent via courier if delivered by post. Nixtla accepts service of process at this address:

**(h) Waiver and Severability**. If you do not comply with these Terms, and Nixtla does not take action right away, this does not mean Nixtla is giving up any of our rights. Except as provided in Section 8, if any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and it will not affect the enforceability of any other terms.

**(l) Jurisdiction, Venue and Choice of Law**. These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding California's conflicts of law rules or principles.
