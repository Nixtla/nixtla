In certain circumstances we may provide your Personal Information to third parties without further notice to you, unless required by the law:

**Vendors and Service Providers**. To assist us in meeting business operations needs and to perform certain services and functions, we may provide Personal Information to vendors and service providers, including providers of hosting services, cloud services, and other information technology services providers, email communication software, and web analytics services, among others. Pursuant to our instructions, these parties will access, process, or store Personal Information only in the course of performing their duties to us.

**Business Transfers**. If we are involved in strategic transactions, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, or transition of service to another provider (collectively, a “**Transaction**”), your Personal Information and other information may be disclosed in the diligence process with counterparties and others assisting with the Transaction and transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that Transaction along with other assets.

**Legal Requirements**. We may share your Personal Information, including information about your interaction with our Services, with government authorities, industry peers, or other third parties (i) if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) if we determine, in our sole discretion, that there is a violation of our terms, policies, or the law; (iv) to detect or prevent fraud or other illegal activity; (v) to protect the safety, security, and integrity of our products, employees, or users, or the public, or (vi) to protect against legal liability.

**Affiliates**. We may disclose Personal Information to our affiliates, meaning an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Nixtla. Our affiliates may use the Personal Information we share in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

# 4. Your choices and controls

Depending on where you live, you may have the right to exercise certain controls and choices regarding our collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Information. To opt-out of marketing communications please email us at [support@nixtla.io](mailto:support@nixtla.io) or by following the instructions included in the email or text correspondence.

Please note that, even if you unsubscribe from certain correspondence, we may still need to contact you with important transactional or administrative information, as permitted by law. Additionally, if you choose not to provide certain Personal Information, we may be unable to provide some or all of our Services to you.

# 5. Children

Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13. Nixtla does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to Nixtla through the Services, please email us at [support@nixtla.io](mailto:support@nixtla.io)

We will investigate any notification and if appropriate, delete the Personal Information from our systems. If you are 13 or older, but under 18, you must have consent from your parent or guardian to use our Services.

# 6. Links to other websites

The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by Nixtla, including social media services (“**Third Party Sites**”). The information that you share with Third Party Sites will be governed by the specific privacy policies and terms of service of the Third Party Sites and not by this Privacy Policy. By providing these links we do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed these sites. Please contact the Third Party Sites directly for information on their privacy practices and policies.

# 7. Security and Retention

We implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect Personal Information both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free. In particular, emails sent to or from us may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via the Services or email. In addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services, or third-party websites.

We’ll retain your Personal Information for only as long as we need in order to provide our Services to you, or for other legitimate business purposes such as resolving disputes, safety and security reasons, or complying with our legal obligations. How long we retain Personal Information will depend on a number of factors, such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, our purpose for processing the information, and any legal requirements.

# 8. Changes to the privacy policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. All changes will be effective immediately upon posting to this page. Material changes will be conspicuously posted on this page or otherwise communicated to you as required by law.
