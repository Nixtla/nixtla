title: About TimeGPT
---

TimeGPT is a production-ready generative pretrained transformer for time
series. It’s capable of accurately predicting various domains such as
retail, electricity, finance, and IoT with just a few lines of code.

It is user-friendly and low-code. Users can simply upload their time
series data and generate forecasts or detect anomalies with just a
single line of code.

TimeGPT is the only out of-the-box foundation model for time series that
can be used through our public APIs, through [Azure Studio as
TimeGEN-1](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-machine-learning-blog/announcing-timegen-1-in-azure-ai-leap-forward-in-time-series/ba-p/4140446)
or on your own infrastructure.

## Features and capabilities

-   **[Zero-shot
    Inference](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/capabilities-forecast-quickstart)**:
    TimeGPT can generate forecasts and detect anomalies straight out of
    the box, requiring no prior training data. This allows for immediate
    deployment and quick insights from any time series data.

-   **[Fine-tuning](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-fine_tuning)**:
    Enhance TimeGPT’s capabilities by fine-tuning the model on your
    specific datasets, enabling the model to adapt to the nuances of
    your unique time series data and improving performance on tailored
    tasks.

-   **[API Access](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/sign_in)**: Integrate
    TimeGPT seamlessly into your applications via our robust API (obtain
    an API key through our
    [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/sign_in)). TimeGPT is also
    supported through [Azure
    Studio](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/deployment-azureai) for even
    more flexible integration options. Alternatively, deploy TimeGPT on
    your own infrastructure to maintain full control over your data and
    workflows.

-   **[Add Exogenous
    Variables](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-exogenous_variables)**:
    Incorporate additional variables that might influence your
    predictions to enhance forecast accuracy. (E.g. Special Dates,
    events or prices)

-   **[Multiple Series
    Forecasting](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-multiple_series_forecasting)**:
    Simultaneously forecast multiple time series data, optimizing
    workflows and resources.

-   **[Specific Loss
    Function](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-fine_tuning_with_a_specific_loss_function)**:
    Tailor the fine-tuning process by choosing from many loss functions
    to meet specific performance metrics.

-   **[Cross-validation](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-cross_validation)**:
    Implement out of the box cross-validation techniques to ensure model
    robustness and generalizability.

-   **[Prediction
    Intervals](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-prediction_intervals)**:
    Provide intervals in your predictions to quantify uncertainty
    effectively.

-   **[Irregular
    Timestamps](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/capabilities-forecast-irregular_timestamps)**:
    Handle data with irregular timestamps, accommodating non-uniform
    interval series without preprocessing.

-   **[Anomaly
    Detection](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-anomaly_detection)**:
    Automatically detect anomalies in time series, and use exogenous
    features for enhanced performance.

real-world use cases in our documentation.**

## Architecture

Self-attention, the revolutionary concept introduced by the paper
[Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), is the
basis of this foundation model. TimeGPT model is not based on any
existing large language model(LLM). Instead, it is independently trained
on a vast amount of time series data, and the large transformer model is
designed to minimize the forecasting error.

The architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure with multiple
layers, each with residual connections and layer normalization. Finally,
a linear layer maps the decoder’s output to the forecasting window
dimension. The general intuition is that attention-based mechanisms are
able to capture the diversity of past events and correctly extrapolate
potential future distributions.

To make prediction, TimeGPT “reads” the input series much like the way
humans read a sentence – from left to right. It looks at windows of past
data, which we can think of as “tokens”, and predicts what comes next.
This prediction is based on patterns the model identifies in past data
and extrapolates into the future.
