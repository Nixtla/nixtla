title: Setting up your API key
---


This tutorial will explain how to set up your API key when using the
Nixtla SDK. To create an `Api Key` go to your
[Dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/).

There are different ways to set up your API key. We provide some
examples below. A scematic is given below.

Another method, permanent. Create .env File. Set API Key in file. Validate API Key." />

## 1. Copy and paste your key directly into your Python code

This approach is straightforward and best for quick tests or scripts
that won’t be shared.

-   **Step 1**: Copy the API key found in the `API Keys` of your [Nixtla
    dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/).
-   **Step 2**: Paste the key directly into your Python code, by
    instantiating the
    [`NixtlaClient`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient)
    with your API key:

```python
from nixtla import NixtlaClient 
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(api_key ='your API key here')
```

> **Important**
>
> This approach is considered unsecure, as your API key will be part of
> your source code.

## 2. Secure: using an environment variable

-   **Step 1**: Store your API key in an environment variable named
    `NIXTLA_API_KEY`. This can be done (a) temporarily for a session
    or (b) permanently, depending on your preference.
-   **Step 2**: When you instantiate the
    [`NixtlaClient`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient)
    class, the SDK will automatically look for the `NIXTLA_API_KEY`
    environment variable and use it to authenticate your requests.

> **Important**
>
> The environment variable must be named exactly `NIXTLA_API_KEY`, with
> all capital letters and no deviations in spelling, for the SDK to
> recognize it.

### a. Temporary: From the Terminal

This approach is useful if you are working from a terminal, and need a
temporary solution.

#### Linux / Mac

Open a terminal and use the `export` command to set `NIXTLA_API_KEY`.

```bash
export NIXTLA_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

#### Windows

For Windows users, open a Powershell window and use the `Set` command to
set `NIXTLA_API_KEY`.

```powershell
Set NIXTLA_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### b. Permanent: Using a `.env` file

For a more persistent solution place your API key in a `.env` file
located in the folder of your Python script. In this file, include the
following:

```python
NIXTLA_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

You can now load the environment variable within your Python script. Use
the `dotenv` package to load the `.env` file and then instantiate the
`NIXTLA_API_KEY` class. For example:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from nixtla import NixtlaClient
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient()
```

This approach is more secure and suitable for applications that will be
deployed or shared, as it keeps API keys out of the source code.

> **Important**
>
> Remember, your API key is like a password - keep it secret, keep it
> safe!

## 3. Validate your API key

You can always find your API key in the `API Keys` section of your
dashboard. To check the status of your API key, use the
`validate_api_key` method of the
[`NixtlaClient`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient)
class. This method will return `True` if the API key is valid and
`False` otherwise.

```python
nixtla_client.validate_api_key()
```

You don’t need to validate your API key every time you use `TimeGPT`.
This function is provided for your convenience to ensure its validity.
For full access to `TimeGPT`’s functionalities, in addition to a valid
API key, you also need sufficient credits in your account. You can check
your credits in the `Usage` section of your
[dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/).
