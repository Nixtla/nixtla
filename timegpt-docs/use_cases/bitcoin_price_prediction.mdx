## Introduction

Forecasting time series is a foundational task in finance, supporting decisions for trading, risk management, and strategic planning. However, predicting future asset prices can be complicated due to market volatility. TimeGPT helps streamline this process by providing robust forecasting capabilities for professionals who need accurate financial predictions.

This guide demonstrates Bitcoin price prediction using TimeGPT, including uncertainty quantification for risk management and informed decision-making.

### Why Forecast Bitcoin Prices

Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency, recorded on a public ledger known as the blockchain. It is widely traded, and its price is highly volatile, making accurate forecasting a valuable tool for financial analysis, trading strategies, and risk management.

### What You'll Learn

- How to load and prepare Bitcoin price data
- How to generate short-term forecasts with TimeGPT
- How to visualize and interpret forecast results
- How to detect anomalies and add exogenous variables

The procedures in this tutorial apply to many financial asset forecasting scenarios, not just Bitcoin.

## How to Use TimeGPT to Forecast Bitcoin Prices

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nixtla/nixtla/blob/main/nbs/docs/use-cases/2_bitcoin_price_prediction.ipynb)

### Step 1: Load Bitcoin Price Data

Bitcoin (₿) is the first decentralized digital currency, with transactions recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. Bitcoins are created through mining—solving cryptographic tasks—and are used for payments, trading, and long-term investment.

For convenience, we'll rename columns to match TimeGPT's expected `ds` (date) and `y` (target) format.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/main/datasets/bitcoin_price_usd.csv',
    sep=','
)

df.head()
```

This dataset includes daily Bitcoin closing prices (in USD) from 2020-01-01 to 2023-12-31. While Bitcoin trades continuously, "closing price" here refers to a specific daily time rather than a traditional market close.

```python
# Rename the columns for convenience
df.rename(columns={'Date': 'ds', 'Close': 'y'}, inplace=True)
```


### Step 2: Get Started with TimeGPT

Initialize the `NixtlaClient` with your Nixtla API key.

```python
from nixtla import NixtlaClient

nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(
    api_key='my_api_key_provided_by_nixtla'
)
```


### Step 3: Visualize the Data

TimeGPT's client offers a convenient `plot` method to visualize your data:

```python
nixtla_client.plot(df)
```

</Frame>

If you did not rename the columns, specify them explicitly:

```python
nixtla_client.plot(
    df,
    time_col='Date Column',
    target_col='Close Column'
)
```


### Step 4: Forecast with TimeGPT

Forecast the next 7 days using TimeGPT:

```python
level = [50, 80, 90]

fcst = nixtla_client.forecast(
    df,
    h=7,
    level=level
)

fcst.head()
```

Visualize the forecast with historical data:

```python
nixtla_client.plot(df, fcst, level=level)
```

</Frame>


### Step 5: Extend Bitcoin Price Analysis with TimeGPT

```python
anomalies_df = nixtla_client.detect_anomalies(df)

nixtla_client.plot(
  df,
  anomalies_df,
  plot_anomalies=True
)
```

</Frame>

[Anomaly Detection Tutorial](/anomaly_detection/real-time/introduction).


### Step 6: Add Exogenous Variables

You can enhance your forecast accuracy by adding external (exogenous) variables:

Exogenous variables could include macroeconomic indicators, social media sentiment, or other data that might correlate with Bitcoin price.

Learn more in the [Exogenous Variables Tutorial](/forecasting/exogenous-variables/numeric_features).


### Step 7: Understand the Model Limitations

<Warning>
  Forecasting financial assets, especially cryptocurrencies, is inherently challenging. High volatility and market sentiment can lead to rapid price swings that limit model reliability.
</Warning>

TimeGPT offers:
- Point forecasts
- Uncertainty quantification
- In-sample forecasting
- Anomaly detection
- Exogenous variable integration

However, it cannot guarantee future accuracy. For questions about advanced use cases, visit the
[TimeGPT Documentation](https://docs.nixtla.io/).
