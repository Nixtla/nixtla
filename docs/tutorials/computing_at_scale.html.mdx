Handling large datasets is a common challenge in time series
forecasting. For example, when working with retail data, you may have to
forecast sales for thousands of products across hundreds of stores.
Similarly, when dealing with electricity consumption data, you may need
to predict consumption for thousands of households across various
regions.

Nixtla’s `TimeGPT` enables you to use several distributed computing
frameworks to manage large datasets efficiently. `TimeGPT` currently
supports `Spark`, `Dask`, and `Ray` through `Fugue`.

In this notebook, we will explain how to leverage these frameworks using
`TimeGPT`.

**Outline:**

1.  [Getting Started](#1-getting-started)

2.  [Forecasting at Scale](#2-forecasting-at-scale)

3.  [Important Considerations](#3-important-considerations)

## Getting started

To use `TimeGPT` with any of the supported distributed computing
frameworks, you first need an API Key, just as you would when not using
any distributed computing.

Upon [registration](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/), you will receive an
email asking you to confirm your signup. After confirming, you will
receive access to your dashboard. There, under`API Keys`, you will find
your API Key. Next, you need to integrate your API Key into your
development workflow with the Nixtla SDK. For guidance on how to do
this, please refer to the [Setting Up Your Authentication Key
tutorial](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/setting_up_your_authentication_api_key).

## Forecasting at Scale

Using `TimeGPT` with any of the supported distributed computing
frameworks is straightforward, as `TimeGPT` will read a `pandas`
DataFrame and then use the corresponding framework. Thus, the usage is
almost identical to the non-distributed case.

1.  Instantiate a `NixtlaClient` class.
2.  Load your data as a `pandas` DataFrame.
3.  Initialize the distributed computing framework.
    -   [Spark](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/computing_at_scale_spark)
    -   [Dask](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/computing_at_scale_dask)
    -   [Ray](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/computing_at_scale_ray)
4.  Use any of the `NixtlaClient` class methods.
5.  Stop the distributed computing framework, if necessary.

These are the general steps that you will need to follow to use
`TimeGPT` with any of the supported distributed computing frameworks.
For a detailed explanation and a complete example, please refer to the
guide for the specific framework linked above.

## Important Considerations

### When to Use a Distributed Computing Framework

Consider using a distributed computing framework if your dataset:

-   Consists of millions of observations over multiple time series.
-   Is too large to fit into the memory of a single machine.
-   Would be too slow to process on a single machine.

### Choosing the Right Framework

When selecting a distributed computing framework, take into account your
existing infrastructure and the skill set of your team. Although
`TimeGPT` can be used with any of the supported frameworks with minimal
code changes, choosing the right one should align with your specific
needs and resources. This will ensure that you leverage the full
potential of `TimeGPT` while handling large datasets efficiently.
