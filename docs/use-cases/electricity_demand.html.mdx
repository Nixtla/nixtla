title: Forecasting Energy Demand
---


This tutorial is based on the scenario used in
[Skforecast](https://cienciadedatos.net/documentos/py29-forecasting-electricity-power-demand-python.html).

Here, we use the [Australian Electricity Demand
dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/4659727). This dataset compiles the
energy demand for five Australian cities at a half-hourly frequency.

In this experiment, we show that using TimeGPT delivers significant
improvements over using a state-of-the-art deep learning model like
N-HiTS in a just a few lines of code:

-   MAE of TimeGPT is **7.8% better** than N-HiTS
-   sMAPE of TimeGPT is **11.5% better** than N-HiTS
-   TimeGPT generated predictions in **7.7 seconds**, which is **88%
    faster** than training and predicting with N-HiTS.

The following tutorial explore all the steps in detail to reproduce
these results so that you can apply TimeGPT in your own project.

## Initial setup

First, we load the required packages for this experiment.

```python
import time
import requests
import pandas as pd

from nixtla import NixtlaClient

from utilsforecast.losses import mae, smape
from utilsforecast.evaluation import evaluate
```

Of course, we need an instance of `NixtlaClient` to use TimeGPT.

```python
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(
    # defaults to os.environ.get("NIXTLA_API_KEY")
    api_key = 'my_api_key_provided_by_nixtla'
)
```

## Read the data

Here, we define a helper function to help us read the `.tsf` file that
contains our data. The dataset is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/blob/main/datasets/australian_electricity_demand_dataset.tsf).

```python
def read_tsf_from_url(url):
    data = []
    start_date = pd.to_datetime('2002-01-01 00:00:00')
    
    # Fetch the content from the URL
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()

    # Process each line of the file
    for line in response.text.splitlines():
        if line.startswith('T'):
            parts = line.strip().split(':')
            unique_id = parts[0] + '-' + parts[1]
            values = list(map(float, parts[3].split(',')[:-1]))
            
            # Generate datetime index at half-hour intervals
            periods = len(values)
            date_range = pd.date_range(start=start_date, periods=periods, freq='30min')
            
            # Append to data list
            for dt, value in zip(date_range, values):
                data.append([unique_id, dt, value])

    return pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['unique_id', 'ds', 'y'])

url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/main/datasets/australian_electricity_demand_dataset.tsf'
df = read_tsf_from_url(url)
```


```python
df.groupby('unique_id').head(2)
```

|        | unique_id | ds                  | y           |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| 0      | T1-NSW    | 2002-01-01 00:00:00 | 5714.045004 |
| 1      | T1-NSW    | 2002-01-01 00:30:00 | 5360.189078 |
| 230735 | T2-VIC    | 2002-01-01 00:00:00 | 3535.867064 |
| 230736 | T2-VIC    | 2002-01-01 00:30:00 | 3383.499028 |
| 461470 | T3-QUN    | 2002-01-01 00:00:00 | 3382.041342 |
| 461471 | T3-QUN    | 2002-01-01 00:30:00 | 3288.315794 |
| 693741 | T4-SA     | 2002-01-01 00:00:00 | 1191.078014 |
| 693742 | T4-SA     | 2002-01-01 00:30:00 | 1219.589472 |
| 924524 | T5-TAS    | 2002-01-01 00:00:00 | 315.915504  |
| 924525 | T5-TAS    | 2002-01-01 00:30:00 | 306.245864  |

Let’s plot our series to see what it looks like.

```python
nixtla_client.plot(
    df, 
    max_insample_length=365, 
)
```

![](/nixtla/docs/use-cases/3_electricity_demand_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-7-output-1.png)

We can see clear sesaonal pattern in all of our series. It will be
interesting to see how TimeGPT handles this type of data.

## Forecasting with TimeGPT

### Splitting the data

The first step is to split our data. Here, we define an input DataFrame
to feed to the model. We also reserve the last 96 time steps for the
test set, so that we can evaluate the performance of TimeGPT against
actual values.

For this situation, we use a forecast horizon of 96, which represents
two days, and we use an input sequence of 21 days, which is 1008 time
steps.

```python
test_df = df.groupby('unique_id').tail(96)                                                             # 96 = 2 days (96 * 0.5h *  1 day/24h )

input_df = df.groupby('unique_id').apply(lambda group: group.iloc[-1104:-96]).reset_index(drop=True)   # 1008 = 21 days (1008 *0.5h * 1 day/24h)
```

### Forecasting

Then, we simply call the `forecast` method. Here, we use fine-tuning and
specify the mean absolute error (MAE) as the fine-tuning loss. Also, we
use the `timegpt-1-long-horizon` since we are forecasting the next two
days, and the seasoanl period is one day.

```python
start = time.time()

fcst_df = nixtla_client.forecast(
    df=input_df,
    h=96,                            
    level=[90],                        # Generate a 90% confidence interval
    finetune_steps=10,                 # Specify the number of steps for fine-tuning
    finetune_loss='mae',               # Use the MAE as the loss function for fine-tuning
    model='timegpt-1-long-horizon',    # Use the model for long-horizon forecasting
    time_col='ds',
    target_col='y',
    id_col='unique_id'
)

end = time.time()

timegpt_duration = end - start

print(f"Time (TimeGPT): {timegpt_duration}")
```

TimeGPT was done in 7.7 seconds! We can now plot the predictions against
the actual values of the test set.

```python
nixtla_client.plot(test_df, fcst_df, models=['TimeGPT'], level=[90], time_col='ds', target_col='y')
```

![](/nixtla/docs/use-cases/3_electricity_demand_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-10-output-1.png)

### Evaluation

Now that we have predictions, let’s evaluate the model’s performance.

```python
fcst_df['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(fcst_df['ds'])

test_df = pd.merge(test_df, fcst_df, 'left', ['unique_id', 'ds'])
```


```python
evaluation = evaluate(
    test_df,
    metrics=[mae, smape],
    models=["TimeGPT"],
    target_col="y",
    id_col='unique_id'
)

average_metrics = evaluation.groupby('metric')['TimeGPT'].mean()
average_metrics
```

``` text
metric
mae      198.822477
smape      0.041998
Name: TimeGPT, dtype: float64
```

We can see that TimeGPT achieves a MAE of 198.82 and a sMAPE of 4.2%.

Great! Now, let’s see if a data-specific model can do better.

## Forecasting with N-HiTS

Here, we use the N-HiTS model, as it is very fast to train and performs
well on long-horizon forecasting tasks. To reproduce these results, make
sure to install the library `neuralforecast`.

```python
from neuralforecast.core import NeuralForecast
from neuralforecast.models import NHITS
```

### Define the training set

The training set is different from the input DataFrame for TimeGPT, as
we need more data to train a data-specific model.

Note that the dataset is very large, so we use the last 400 days of the
training set to fit our model.

```python
train_df = df.groupby('unique_id').apply(lambda group: group.iloc[-9696:-96]).reset_index(drop=True)
```

### Forecasting with N-HiTS

We can now fit the model on training set and make predictions.

```python
horizon = 96

models = [NHITS(h=horizon, input_size = 5*horizon, scaler_type='robust', batch_size=16, valid_batch_size=8)]

nf = NeuralForecast(models=models, freq='30min')

start = time.time()

nf.fit(df=train_df)
nhits_preds = nf.predict()

end = time.time()

nhits_duration = end - start

print(f"Time (N-HiTS): {nhits_duration}")
```

Great! Note that N-HiTS took 67 seconds to carry out the training and
forecasting procedures. Now, let’s evaluate the performance of this
model.

### Evaluation

```python
preds_df = pd.merge(test_df, nhits_preds, 'left', ['unique_id', 'ds'])

evaluation = evaluate(
    preds_df,
    metrics=[mae, smape],
    models=["NHITS"],
    target_col="y",
    id_col='unique_id'
)


average_metrics = evaluation.groupby('metric')['NHITS'].mean()
print(average_metrics)
```

## Conclusion

TimeGPT achieves a MAE of 198.82 while N-HiTS achieves a MAE of 215.55,
meaning there is a **7.8% improvement** in using TimeGPT versus our
data-specific N-HiTS model. TimeGPT also improved the sMAPE by 11.5%.

Plus, TimeGPT took 7.7 seconds to generate forecasts, while N-HiTS took
67 seconds to fit and predict. TimeGPT is thus **88% faster** than using
N-HiTS in this scenario.
