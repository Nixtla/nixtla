    "- **Trend**: The consistent, long-term direction of the data, whether upward or downward. It reflects the persistent, overall movement in the series over time.\n",
    "\n",

    "Forecasting is the process of predicting the future values of a time series based on historical data. It plays a crucial role in the decision-making process across various fields such as finance, healthcare, retail, and economics, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting can use a variety of approaches, from statistical approaches to novel techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and foundation models. These models can be further classified into univariate and multivariate models, depending on the number of variables used to make the predictions, or local or global models, with local models estimating parameters independently for each series and global models estimating parameters jointly across multiple series.\n",

    "Forecasts themselves can be presented as point forecasts, which predict a single future value, or as probabilistic forecasts, which provide a full probability distribution of future values, and hence, providing a measure of uncertainty.\n",

TimeGPT was trained on billions of observations from publicly available datasets across multiple domains and can produce accurate forecasts for new time series without additional training, using only historical values as inputs. The model 'reads' time series data similarly to how humans read a sentenceâ€”sequentially from left to right. It looks at windows of past data, which we can think of as 'tokens', and predicts what comes next. This prediction is based on patterns the model identifies in past data and extrapolates into the future.\n",

    "Fine-tuning is a process used in machine learning where a pre-trained model like TimeGPT undergoes additional training to adapt it for a specific dataset. Initially, TimeGPT can operate in a zero-shot manner, meaning it can generate forecasts as-is. While this zero-shot approach provides a solid baseline, the performance of TimeGPT can often be improved through fine-tuning. During this process, the TimeGPT model undergoes additional training using the specific dataset, starting from the pre-trained parameters. The updated model then produces the forecasts.\n",

    "Anomaly detection refers to the process of identifying unusual observations that deviate significantly from the expected behavior of the data. Anomalies, also known as outliers, can be caused by a variety of factors, such as errors in the data collection process, sudden changes in the underlying patterns of the data, or unexpected events. These anomalies can pose challenges for many forecasting models, as they may distort trends, seasonal patterns, or estimates of autocorrelation. Consequently, anomalies can significantly impact the accuracy of forecasts. Therefore, it is crucial to be able to identify them accurately.\n",

    "\n",
    "Time series cross-validation is a method for evaluating how a model would have performed on historical data. It works by defining a sliding window across past observations and predicting the period following it. It differs from standard cross-validation by maintaining the chronological order of the data instead of randomly splitting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows for a more accurate estimation of a forecasting model's predictive capabilities by considering multiple sequential periods. When only one window is used, this method resembles a standard train-test split, with the last set of observations serving as the test data and all preceding data as the training set.\n",
