# Nixtla

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Who We Are">
    Nixtla is to numbers what Anthropic or Open AI are to language and images. We are the creators of TimeGPT—a pre-trained model that allows enterprises to upload their data and receive predictions within minutes. This approach saves significant money, development time, and maintenance effort.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Our Impact">
    TimeGPT was trained on the largest collection of time series data in history—over 100 billion rows across financial, weather, energy, and web data. Nixtla has also built the most comprehensive time series ecosystem, with over 5 million downloads worldwide. Our software is trusted and used in production by leading companies such as Amazon, Walmart, and Lyft.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Our Philosophy">
    We are a group of hackers driven by curiosity and a profound desire to make a meaningful impact. With backgrounds ranging from research and development to philosophy, we have united to revolutionize the time series field. We embrace diversity, champion inclusivity, and believe that the future belongs to everyone.
  </Card>

<Info>
  We stand by our roots in Latin America. We are queer, we are different, and we take pride in it. Our shared passion for understanding the world guides us in pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with time series analysis.

## Our Open Source Initiatives

TimeGPT is only one part of our story. Before its creation, Nixtla developed an open-source time series ecosystem that quickly flourished, garnering millions of downloads.

## Our Origin Story

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="A Simple Start">
    Nixtla began as a side project. We built tools for an old company we worked for, and then everyone took different paths—some pursued academic careers, others founded companies, and some focused on shipping products.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Growth and Collaboration">
    We eventually reunited to turn what started as a modest open-source library into the most comprehensive time-series ecosystem. By challenging the status quo and giants like Facebook, Amazon, and Google, we proved how a dedicated group of passionate individuals, powered by open-source software, can successfully compete with major players.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A Global Community">
    As Nixtla’s usage soared, our community grew, fueling our development. Today, Nixtla is the most impactful time series ecosystem worldwide, relied upon by innovators in both industry and academia.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Envisioning the Future">
    Recognizing this was only the beginning, we set our sights on a new challenge—pioneering foundation models for time series. This breakthrough helps us share the future of data science with everyone.
