## Introduction

Forecasting time series is a foundational task in finance, supporting decisions for trading, risk management, and strategic planning. However, predicting future asset prices can be complicated due to market volatility. TimeGPT helps streamline this process by providing robust forecasting capabilities for professionals who need accurate financial predictions.

This guide demonstrates Bitcoin price prediction using TimeGPT, including uncertainty quantification for risk management and informed decision-making.

  <Card title="Why Forecast Bitcoin Prices">
    Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency, recorded on a public ledger known as the blockchain. It is widely traded, and its price is highly volatile, making accurate forecasting a valuable tool for financial analysis, trading strategies, and risk management.

## 1. Load Bitcoin Price Data

Bitcoin (₿) is the first decentralized digital currency, with transactions recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. Bitcoins are created through mining—solving cryptographic tasks—and are used for payments, trading, and long-term investment.

<Info>
  For convenience, we'll rename columns to match TimeGPT's expected `ds` (date) and `y` (target) format.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```python Load Bitcoin Dataset
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/main/datasets/bitcoin_price_usd.csv',
    sep=','
)

df.head()
```
</CodeGroup>

This dataset includes daily Bitcoin closing prices (in USD) from 2020-01-01 to 2023-12-31. While Bitcoin trades continuously, "closing price" here refers to a specific daily time rather than a traditional market close.

<CodeGroup>
```python Rename Columns for TimeGPT
# Rename the columns for convenience
df.rename(columns={'Date': 'ds', 'Close': 'y'}, inplace=True)
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## 2. Get Started with TimeGPT

Initialize the `NixtlaClient` with your Nixtla API key.

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialize NixtlaClient
from nixtla import NixtlaClient

nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(
    api_key='my_api_key_provided_by_nixtla'
)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  When using Azure AI, you must also specify `base_url` in the `NixtlaClient`.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Default Endpoint">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Default NixtlaClient Endpoint
from nixtla import NixtlaClient

nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(
    api_key="my_api_key_provided_by_nixtla"
)
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Azure AI Endpoint">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Azure AI NixtlaClient Endpoint
from nixtla import NixtlaClient

nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(
    base_url="your Azure AI endpoint",
    api_key="your api_key"
)
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can learn more about API keys in the [Nixtla Authentication Guide](/setup/setting_up_your_api_key).

## 3. Visualize the Data

TimeGPT's client offers a convenient `plot` method to visualize your data:

<CodeGroup>
```python Plot Bitcoin Price Data
nixtla_client.plot(df)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Frame caption="Bitcoin Price Data">
  ![Bitcoin Price Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/nixtla/readme_docs/nbs/_docs/docs/use-cases/2_bitcoin_price_prediction_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-12-output-1.png)
</Frame>

If you did not rename the columns, specify them explicitly:

<CodeGroup>
```python Plot with Explicit Columns
nixtla_client.plot(
    df,
    time_col='Date Column',
    target_col='Close Column'
)
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## 4. Forecast with TimeGPT

Forecast the next 7 days using TimeGPT:

<CodeGroup>
```python Forecast Next 7 Days
level = [50, 80, 90]

fcst = nixtla_client.forecast(
    df,
    h=7,
    level=level
)

fcst.head()
```
</CodeGroup>

Visualize the forecast with historical data:

<CodeGroup>
```python Plot Forecast and Historical Data
nixtla_client.plot(df, fcst, level=level)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Frame caption="Panel view of historical data with future forecasts">
  ![Panel view of historical data with future forecasts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/nixtla/readme_docs/nbs/_docs/docs/use-cases/2_bitcoin_price_prediction_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-14-output-1.png)
</Frame>

## 5. Extend Bitcoin Price Analysis with TimeGPT

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Anomaly Detection">
    Easily detect anomalies in your dataset:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Detect Anomalies
anomalies_df = nixtla_client.detect_anomalies(df)

nixtla_client.plot(
    df,
    anomalies_df,
    plot_anomalies=True
)
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Frame caption="Highlighted anomalies in Bitcoin price data">
      ![Highlighted anomalies in Bitcoin price data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/nixtla/readme_docs/nbs/_docs/docs/use-cases/2_bitcoin_price_prediction_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-19-output-1.png)
    </Frame>

    For more details on anomaly detection, visit the
    [Anomaly Detection Tutorial](/anomaly_detection/real-time/introduction).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Exogenous Variables">
    You can enhance your forecast accuracy by adding external (exogenous) variables:

    <Info>
      Exogenous variables could include macroeconomic indicators, social media sentiment, or other data that might correlate with Bitcoin price.
    </Info>

    Learn more in the [Exogenous Variables Tutorial](/forecasting/exogenous-variables/numeric_features).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Understand the Model Limitations

<Warning>
  Forecasting financial assets, especially cryptocurrencies, is inherently challenging. High volatility and market sentiment can lead to rapid price swings that limit model reliability.
</Warning>

TimeGPT offers:
• Point forecasts
• Uncertainty quantification
• In-sample forecasting
• Anomaly detection
• Exogenous variable integration

However, it cannot guarantee future accuracy. For questions about advanced use cases, visit the
[TimeGPT Documentation](https://docs.nixtla.io/).
