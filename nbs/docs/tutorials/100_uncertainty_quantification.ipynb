    "# Uncertainty quantification\n",
    "\n",
    "In forecasting, it is essential to consider the full distribution of predictions rather than only a point prediction. This approach allows for a better understanding of the uncertainty surrounding the forecast. `TimeGPT` supports uncertainty quantification through quantile forecasts and prediction intervals.\n",
