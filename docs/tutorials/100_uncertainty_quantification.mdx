title: Uncertainty quantification
---

In forecasting, it is essential to consider the full distribution of
predictions rather than only a point prediction. This approach allows
for a better understanding of the uncertainty surrounding the forecast.
`TimeGPT` supports uncertainty quantification through quantile forecasts
and prediction intervals.

### What You Will Learn

1.  **[Quantile
    Forecasts](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-quantile_forecasts)**

    -   Learn how to compute specific quantiles of the forecast
        distribution using `TimeGPT`.

2.  **[Prediction
    Intervals](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-prediction_intervals)**

    -   Learn how to generate prediction intervals with `TimeGPT`, which
        give you a range of values that the forecast can take with a
        given probability.
