## TimeGPT

What is TimeGPT?

`TimeGPT` is the first foundation model for time series forecasting. It
can produce accurate forecasts for new time series across a diverse
array of domains using only historical values as inputs. The model
“reads” time series data sequentially from left to right, similarly to
how humans read a sentence. It looks at windows of past data, which we
can think of as “tokens”, and then predicts what comes next. This
prediction is based on patterns the model identifies and that it
extrapolates into the future. Beyond forecasting, `TimeGPT` supports
other time series related tasks, such as what-if-scenarios, anomaly
detection, and more.

Is TimeGPT based on a Large Language Model (LLM)?

No, `TimeGPT` is not based on any large language model. While it follows
the same principle of training a large transformer model on a vast
dataset, its architecture is specifically designed to handle time series
data and it has been trained to minimize forecasting errors.

How do I get started with TimeGPT?

To get started with `TimeGPT`, you need to register for an account
[here](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/). You will receive an email asking
you to confirm your signup. After confirming, you will be able to access
your dashboard, which contains the details of your account.

How accessible is TimeGPT and what are the usage costs?

For a more in-depth understanding of `TimeGPT`, please refer to the
[research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03589.pdf). While certain
aspects of the model’s architecture remain confidential, registration
for `TimeGPT` is open to all. New users receive \$1,000 USD in free
credits and subsequent usage fees are based on token consumption. For
more details, please refer to the [Pricing and
Billing](#pricing-and-billing) section

How can I use TimeGPT?

-   Through the [Python SDK](https://github.com/Nixtla/nixtla)

-   Via the `TimeGPT` API. For instructions on how to call the API using
    different languages, please refer to the [API
    documentation](https://docs.nixtla.io/reference/timegpt_timegpt_post)

Both methods require you to have a [API key](#timegpt-api-key), which is
obtained upon registration and can be found in your dashboard under
`API Keys`.

## TimeGPT API Key

What is an API key?

An API key is a unique string of characters that serves as a key to
authenticate your requests when using the Nixtla SDK. It ensures that
the person making the requests is authorized to do so.

Where can I get an API key?

Upon registration, you will receive an API key that can be found in your
[dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/) under `API Keys`. Remember
that your API key is personal and should not be shared with anyone.

How do I use my API key?

To integrate your API key into your development workflow, please refer
to the tutorial on [Setting Up Your API
Key](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/getting-started-setting_up_your_api_key).

How can I check the status of my API key?

If you want to check the status of your API key, you can use the
[`validate_api_key`
method](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient-validate-api-key)
of the
[`NixtlaClient`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient)
class.

`nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(     api_key = 'my_api_key_provided_by_nixtla' )`

`nixtla_client.validate_api_key()`

If your key is validating correctly, this will return

``` text
INFO:nixtla.nixtla_client:Happy Forecasting! :), If you have questions or need support, please email support@nixtla.io

True
```

What if my API key isn’t validating?

When you validate your API key and it returns `False`:

-   If you are targeting an Azure endpoint, getting `False` from the
    [`NixtlaClient.validate_api_key`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient.validate_api_key)
    method is expected. You can skip this step when taregting an Azure
    endpoint and proceed diretly to forecasting instead.
-   If you are not taregting an Azure endpoint, then you should check
    the following:
    -   Make sure you are using the latest version of the SDK (Python or
        R).
    -   Check that your API key is active in your dashboard by visiting
        https://dashboard.nixtla.io/
    -   Consider any firewalls your organization might have. There may
        be restricted access. If so, you can whitelist our endpoint
        https://api.nixtla.io/.
        -   To use Nixtla’s API, you need to let your system know that
            our endpoint is ok, so it will let you access it.
            Whitelisting the endpoint isn’t something that Nixtla can do
            on our side. It’s something that needs to be done on the
            user’s system. This is a bit of an [overview on
            whitelisting](https://www.csoonline.com/article/569493/whitelisting-explained-how-it-works-and-where-it-fits-in-a-security-program.html).
        -   If you work in an organization, please work with an IT team.
            They’re likely the ones setting the security and you can
            talk with them to get it addressed. If you run your own
            systems, then it’s something you should be able to update,
            depending on the system you’re using.

## Features and Capabilities

What is the input to TimeGPT?

`TimeGPT` accepts `pandas` dataframes in [long
format](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/wide-and-long-data/#comments)
with the following necessary columns:

-   `ds` (timestamp): timestamp in format `YYYY-MM-DD` or
    `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
-   `y` (numeric): The target variable to forecast.

(Optionally, you can also pass a DataFrame without the `ds` column as
long as it has DatetimeIndex)

`TimeGPT` also works with [distributed
dataframes](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-computing_at_scale)
like `dask`, `spark` and `ray`.

Can TimeGPT handle multiple time series?

Yes. For guidance on forecasting multiple time series at once, consult
the [Multiple
Series](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-multiple_series_forecasting)
tutorial.

Does TimeGPT support forecasting with exogenous variables?

Yes. For instructions on how to incorporate exogenous variables to
`TimeGPT`, see the [Exogenous
Variables](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-exogenous_variables)
tutorial. For incorporating calendar dates specifically, you may find
the [Holidays and Special
Dates](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-holidays_and_special_dates)
tutorial useful. For categorical variables, refer to the [Categorical
Variables](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-categorical_variables)
tutorial.

Can TimeGPT be used for anomaly detection?

Yes. To learn how to use `TimeGPT` for anomaly detection, refer to the
[Anomaly
Detection](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/capabilities-anomaly-detection-anomaly_detection)
tutorial.

Does TimeGPT support cross-validation?

Yes. To learn how to use `TimeGPT` for cross-validation, refer to the
[Cross-Validation](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-cross_validation)
tutorial.

Can TimeGPT be used to forecast historical data?

Yes. To find out how to forecast historical data using `TimeGPT`, see
the [Historical
Forecast](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-historical_forecast)
tutorial.

Can TimeGPT be used for uncertainty quantification?

Yes. For more information, explore the [Prediction
Intervals](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-prediction_intervals)
and [Quantile
Forecasts](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-quantile_forecasts)
tutorials.

Can TimeGPT handle large datasets?

Yes. When dealing with large datasets that contain hundreds of thousands
or millions of time series, we recommend using a distributed backend.
`TimeGPT` is compatible with several [distributed computing
frameworks](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-computing_at_scale),
including [Spark](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-spark),
[Ray](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-ray), and
[Dask](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-dask). Both the `TimeGPT`
SDK and API don’t have a limit on the size of the dataset as long as a
distributed backend is used.

Can TimeGPT be used with limited/short data?

`TimeGPT` supports any amount of data for generating point forecasts and
is capable of producing results with just one observation per series.
When using arguments such as `level`, `finetune_steps`, `X_df`
(exogenous variables), or `add_history`, additional data points are
necessary depending on the data frequency. For more details, please
refer to the [Data
Requirements](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/getting-started-data_requirements)
tutorial.

What is the maximum forecast horizon allowed by TimeGPT?

While `TimeGPT` does not have a maximum forecast horizon, its
performance will decrease as the horizon increases. When the forecast
horizon exceeds the season length of the data (for example, more than 12
months for monthly data), you will get this message:
`WARNING:nixtla.nixtla_client:The specified horizon "h" exceeds the model horizon. This may lead to less accurate forecasts. Please consider using a smaller horizon`.

For details, refer to the tutorial on [Long Horizon in Time
Series](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-long_horizon_forecasting).

Can TimeGPT handle missing values?

`TimeGPT` cannot handle missing values or series with irregular
timestamps. For more information, see the [Forecasting Time Series with
Irregular
Timestamps](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/capabilities-forecast-irregular_timestamps)
and the [Dealing with Missing
Values](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-dealing_with_missing_values_in_timegpt)
tutorial.

How can I plot the TimeGPT forecast?

The
[`NixtlaClient`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient)
class has a [`plot`
method](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient-validate-token)
that can be used to visualize the forecast. This method only works in
interactive environments such as Jupyter notebooks and it doesn’t work
on Python scripts.

Does TimeGPT support polars?

As of now, `TimeGPT` does not offer support for polars.

Does TimeGPT produce stable predictions?

`TimeGPT` is engineered for stability, ensuring consistent results for
identical input data. This means that given the same dataset, the model
will produce the same forecasts.

Can TimeGPT forecast data with simple pattern such as a straight line or
sine wave?

While this is not the primary use case for `TimeGPT`, it is capable of
generating solid results on simple data such as a straight line. While
zero-shot predictions might not always meet expectations, a little help
with fine-tuning allows TimeGPT to quickly grasp the trend and produce
accurate forecasts. For more details, please refer to the [Improve
Forecast Accuracy with
TimeGPT](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-improve_forecast_accuracy_with_timegpt)
tutorial. <video controls width="600">

## Fine-tuning

What is fine-tuning?

`TimeGPT` was trained on the largest publicly available time series
dataset, covering a wide range of domains such as finance, retail,
healthcare, and more. This comprehensive training enables `TimeGPT` to
produce accurate forecasts for new time series without additional
training, a capability known as zero-shot learning.

While the zero-shot model provides a solid baseline, the performance of
`TimeGPT` can often be improved through fine-tuning. During this
process, the `TimeGPT` model undergoes additional training using your
specific dataset, starting from the pre-trained paramaters. The updated
model then produces the forecasts. You can control the number of
training iterations and the loss function for fine-tuning with the
`finetune_steps` and the `finetune_loss` parameters in the `forecast`
method from the
[`NixtlaClient`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient)
class, respectively.

For a comprehensive guide on how to apply fine-tuning, please refer to
the [fine-tuning](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-fine_tuning) and
the [fine-tuning with a specific loss
function](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-fine_tuning_with_a_specific_loss_function)
tutorials.

Do I have to fine-tune every series?

No, you do not need to fine-tune every series individually. When using
the `finetune_steps` parameter, the model undergoes fine-tuning across
all series in your dataset simultaneously. This method uses a
cross-learning approach, allowing the model to learn from multiple
series at once, which can improve individual forecasts.

Keep in mind that selecting the right number of fine-tuning steps may
require some trial and error. As the number of fine-tuning steps
increases, the model becomes more specialized to your dataset, but will
take longer to train and may be more prone to overfitting.

Can I save fine-tuned parameters?

Yes! You can fine-tune the TimeGPT model, save it, and reuse it later.
For detailed instructions, see our guide on [Re-using Fine-tuned
Models](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-re_using_fine_tuned_models).

What counts as an API call?

An API call is a request made to TimeGPT to perform an action like
forecasting or detecting anomalies. API Usage is as follows:

### Forecasting:

1.  When not requesting historical forecasts (`add_history=False`)
    -   If you do not set `num_partitions`, all calls to perform
        [forecasting](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/getting-started-timegpt_quickstart),
        [finetuning](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-fine_tuning),
        or
        [cross-validation](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-cross_validation)
        increase the usage by 1. Note that addition of [exogenous
        variables](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-exogenous_variables),
        requesting [uncertainity
        quantification](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-uncertainty_quantification)
        or forecasting [multiple
        series](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-multiple_series_forecasting)
        does not increase the usage further.
    -   If the API call requires to send more than 200MB of data, the
        API will return an error and will require you to use the
        `num_partitions` parameter in order to partition your request.
        Every partition will count as an API call, hence the usage will
        increase by the value you set for `num_partitions` (e.g. for
        num_partitions=2, the usage will increase by 2). If you set
        `num_partitions`, all calls to perform forecasting, finetuning,
        or cross-validation increase the usage by num_partitions.
2.  When requesting [in-sample
    predictions](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-historical_forecast)
    (`add_history=True`), the usage from #1 above is multipled by 2.

**Examples**

1.  A user uses TimeGPT to forecast daily data, using the `timegpt-1`
    model. How many API calls are made? (*Ans*: 1)
2.  A user calls the `cross_validation` method on a dataset. How many
    API calls are made (*Ans*: 1)
3.  A user decides to forecast on a longer horizon, so they use the
    `timegpt-1-long-horizon` model. How many API calls are made (*Ans*:
    1)
4.  A user needs to get the in-sample predicitons when forecasting using
    `add_history=True`. How many API calls are made (*Ans*: 2)
5.  A user has a very large dataset, with a daily frequency, and they
    must set `num_partitions=4` when forecasting. How many API calls are
    made (*Ans*: 4)
6.  A user has to set `num_partitions=4` and is also interesed in
    getting the in-sample predicitons (`add_history=True`) when
    forecasting. How many API calls are made (*Ans*: 8)

### Anomaly Detection:

1.  If you do not set `num_partitions`, all calls to perform [anomaly
    detection](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/capabilities-anomaly-detection-quickstart)
    increase the usage by 1. Note that addition of [exogenous
    variables](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/capabilities-anomaly-detection-add_exogenous_variables)
    does not increase the usage further.
2.  If the API call requires to send more than 200MB of data, the API
    will return an error and will require you to use the
    `num_partitions` parameter in order to partition your request. Every
    partition will count as an API call, hence the usage will increase
    by the value you set for `num_partitions` (e.g. for
    num_partitions=2, the usage will increase by 2).

How does billing work?

Billing is done through Stripe. We’ve partnered with Stripe to handle
all payment processing. You can view your invoices and payment history

## Troubleshooting

The following section contains some common errors and warnings

<strong>Error message: Invalid API key</strong>

```python
ApiError: status_code: 401, body: {'data': None, 'message': 'Invalid API key', 'details': 'Key not found', 'code': 'A12', 'requestID': 'E7F2BBTB2P', 'support': 'If you have questions or need support, please email support@nixtla.io'}
```

**Solution:** This error occurs when your `TimeGPT` API key is either
invalid or has not been set up correctly. Please use the
`validate_api_key` method to verify it or make sure it was copied
correctly from the `API Keys` section of your
[dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/).

<strong>Error message: Too many requests</strong>

```python
ApiError: status_code: 429, body: {'data': None, 'message': 'Too many requests', 'details': 'You need to add a payment method to continue using the API, do so from https://dashboard.nixtla.io', 'code': 'A21', 'requestID': 'NCJDK7KSJ6', 'support': 'If you have questions or need support, please email support@nixtla.io'}
```

**Solution:** This error occurs when you have exhausted your free
credits and need to add a payment method to continue using `TimeGPT`.
You can add a payment method in the `Billing` section of your
[dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/).

<strong>Error message: WriteTimeout</strong>

**Solution:** If you encounter a `WriteTimeout` error, it means that the
request has exceeded the allowable processing time. This is a common
issue when working with large datasets. To fix this, consider increasing
the `num_partitions` parameter in the [`forecast`
method](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient-forecast)
of the
[`NixtlaClient`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient)
class, or use a distributed backend if not already in use.
