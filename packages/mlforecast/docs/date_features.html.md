##

The `mlforecast.date_features` module provides **calendar features** that you
pass to `MLForecast` through the `date_features` argument. They compute the
same values with the same dtypes for pandas and polars dataframes, including
timezone-aware dates.

```python
from mlforecast import MLForecast
from mlforecast import date_features as dtf

fcst = MLForecast(
    models=[...],
    freq='D',
    date_features=[dtf.day_of_week, dtf.month, dtf.is_month_end],
)
```

`dtf.available()` lists every calendar feature:

| Feature | Values | dtype | One-hot encoded with `date_features_as_dummies=True` |
|---------|--------|-------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `year` | Year. | `uint16` | no |
| `quarter` | Quarter of the year, from 1 to 4. | `uint8` | yes |
| `month` | Month of the year, from 1 to 12. | `uint8` | yes |
| `week_of_year` | ISO week of the year, from 1 to 53. | `uint8` | yes |
| `day` | Day of the month, from 1 to 31. | `uint8` | yes |
| `day_of_week` | Day of the week, from 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday). | `uint8` | yes |
| `day_of_year` | Day of the year, from 1 to 366. | `uint16` | yes |
| `days_in_month` | Number of days in the month, from 28 to 31. | `uint8` | yes |
| `hour` | Hour of the day, from 0 to 23. | `uint8` | yes |
| `minute` | Minute of the hour, from 0 to 59. | `uint8` | yes |
| `second` | Second of the minute, from 0 to 59. | `uint8` | yes |
| `is_month_start` | 1 on the first day of the month, 0 otherwise. | `uint8` | no |
| `is_month_end` | 1 on the last day of the month, 0 otherwise. | `uint8` | no |
| `is_quarter_start` | 1 on the first day of the quarter, 0 otherwise. | `uint8` | no |
| `is_quarter_end` | 1 on the last day of the quarter, 0 otherwise. | `uint8` | no |
| `is_year_start` | 1 on January 1st, 0 otherwise. | `uint8` | no |
| `is_year_end` | 1 on December 31st, 0 otherwise. | `uint8` | no |

Strings (e.g. `'dayofweek'`) are still accepted and use the date attributes of
the dataframe backend, so their names and values can differ between pandas and
polars. Functions that take the dates and return the feature values are also
accepted; see the [custom date features](./docs/how-to-guides/custom_date_features.html)
guide.
