title: SHAP Values for TimeGPT and TimeGEN
---


SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values use game theory to explain
the output of any machine learning model. It allows us to explore in
detail how exogenous features impact the final forecast, both at a
single forecast step or over the entire horizon.

When you forecast with exogenous features, you can access the SHAP
values for all series at each prediction step, and use the popular
[shap](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python package to make
different plots and explain the impact of the features.

This tutorial assumes knowledge on forecasting with exogenous features,
so make sure to read our tutorial on [exogenous
variables](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-exogenous_variables).
Also, the `shap` package must be installed separately as it is not a
dependency of `nixtla`.

`shap` can be installed from either
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/shap/) or
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/shap):

``` text
pip install shap

or

conda install -c conda-forge shap
```

## 1. Import packages

First, we import the required packages and initialize the Nixtla client.

```python
import pandas as pd
from nixtla import NixtlaClient
```


```python
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(
    # defaults to os.environ.get("NIXTLA_API_KEY")
    api_key = 'my_api_key_provided_by_nixtla'
)
```

> 👍 Use an Azure AI endpoint
>
> To use an Azure AI endpoint, remember to set also the `base_url`
> argument:
>
> `nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(base_url="you azure ai endpoint", api_key="your api_key")`

## 2. Load data

In this example on SHAP values, we will use exogenous variables (also
known as covariates) to improve the accuracy of electricity market
forecasts. We’ll work with a well-known dataset called `EPF`, which is
publicly accessible [here](https://zenodo.org/records/4624805).

This dataset includes data from five different electricity markets, each
with unique price dynamics, such as varying frequencies and occurrences
of negative prices, zeros, and price spikes. Since electricity prices
are influenced by exogenous factors, each dataset also contains two
additional time series: day-ahead forecasts of two significant exogenous
factors specific to each market.

For simplicity, we will focus on the Belgian electricity market (BE).
This dataset includes hourly prices (`y`), day-ahead forecasts of load
(`Exogenous1`), and electricity generation (`Exogenous2`). It also
includes one-hot encoding to indicate whether a specific date is a
specific day of the week. Eg.: Monday (`day_0 = 1`), a Tuesday
(`day_1 = 1`), and so on.

If your data depends on exogenous factors or covariates such as prices,
discounts, special holidays, weather, etc., you can follow a similar
structure.

```python
market = "BE"
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/main/datasets/electricity-short-with-ex-vars.csv')
df.head()
```

|  | unique_id | ds | y | Exogenous1 | Exogenous2 | day_0 | day_1 | day_2 | day_3 | day_4 | day_5 | day_6 |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | BE | 2016-10-22 00:00:00 | 70.00 | 57253.0 | 49593.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |
| 1 | BE | 2016-10-22 01:00:00 | 37.10 | 51887.0 | 46073.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |
| 2 | BE | 2016-10-22 02:00:00 | 37.10 | 51896.0 | 44927.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |
| 3 | BE | 2016-10-22 03:00:00 | 44.75 | 48428.0 | 44483.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |
| 4 | BE | 2016-10-22 04:00:00 | 37.10 | 46721.0 | 44338.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |

## 3. Forecasting electricity prices using exogenous variables

To produce forecasts we also have to add the future values of the
exogenous variables.

If your forecast depends on other variables, it is important to ensure
that those variables are available at the time of forecasting. In this
example, we know that the price of electricity depends on the demand
(`Exogenous1`) and the quantity produced (`Exogenous2`). Thus, we need
to have those future values available at the time of forecasting. If
those values were not available, we can always [use TimeGPT to forecast
them](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-exogenous_variables).

Here, we read a dataset that contains the future values of our features.
In this case, we want to predict 24 steps ahead, therefore each
`unique_id` will have 24 observations.

> **Important**
>
> If you want to use exogenous variables when forecasting with TimeGPT,
> you need to have the future values of those exogenous variables too.

```python
future_ex_vars_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/main/datasets/electricity-short-future-ex-vars.csv')
future_ex_vars_df.head()
```

|  | unique_id | ds | Exogenous1 | Exogenous2 | day_0 | day_1 | day_2 | day_3 | day_4 | day_5 | day_6 |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | BE | 2016-12-31 00:00:00 | 70318.0 | 64108.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |
| 1 | BE | 2016-12-31 01:00:00 | 67898.0 | 62492.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |
| 2 | BE | 2016-12-31 02:00:00 | 68379.0 | 61571.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |
| 3 | BE | 2016-12-31 03:00:00 | 64972.0 | 60381.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |
| 4 | BE | 2016-12-31 04:00:00 | 62900.0 | 60298.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |

Let’s call the `forecast` method, adding this information. To access the
SHAP values, we also need to specify `feature_contributions=True` in the
`forecast` method.

```python
timegpt_fcst_ex_vars_df = nixtla_client.forecast(df=df, 
                                                 X_df=future_ex_vars_df, 
                                                 h=24, 
                                                 level=[80, 90],
                                                 feature_contributions=True)
timegpt_fcst_ex_vars_df.head()
```

## 4. Extract SHAP values

Now that we have made predictions using exogenous features, we can then
extract the SHAP values to understand their relevance using the
`feature_contributions` attribute of the client. This returns a
DataFrame containing the SHAP values and base values for each series, at
each step in the horizon.

```python
shap_df = nixtla_client.feature_contributions
shap_df = shap_df.query("unique_id == @market")
shap_df.head()
```

|  | unique_id | ds | TimeGPT | Exogenous1 | Exogenous2 | day_0 | day_1 | day_2 | day_3 | day_4 | day_5 | day_6 | base_value |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | BE | 2016-12-31 00:00:00 | 51.632830 | 27.929638 | -16.363607 | 0.081917 | -1.883555 | 0.346484 | -0.228611 | 0.424167 | -3.411662 | 1.113910 | 43.624146 |
| 1 | BE | 2016-12-31 01:00:00 | 45.750877 | 17.678530 | -12.240089 | -0.758545 | -0.077536 | -0.160390 | -0.309567 | 0.871469 | -3.927268 | 1.218714 | 43.455560 |
| 2 | BE | 2016-12-31 02:00:00 | 39.650543 | 21.632694 | -21.400244 | -0.926842 | -0.470276 | -0.022417 | -0.225389 | 0.220258 | -3.927268 | 1.145736 | 43.624290 |
| 3 | BE | 2016-12-31 03:00:00 | 34.000072 | 13.879354 | -20.681124 | -0.114050 | -0.488141 | 0.048164 | -0.126627 | 0.200692 | -3.400485 | 1.144959 | 43.537330 |
| 4 | BE | 2016-12-31 04:00:00 | 33.785370 | 13.465129 | -20.619830 | -0.036112 | -0.470496 | 0.048375 | -0.126627 | 0.200692 | -3.400485 | 1.144959 | 43.579760 |

In the Dataframe above, we can see that we have the SHAP values at every
forecasting step, as well as the prediction from TimeGPT and the base
value. Note that the base value is the prediction of the model if
exogenous features were unknown.

Therefore, the forecast from TimeGPT is equal to the sum of the base
value and the SHAP values of each exogenous feature in a given row.

## 5. Make plots using `shap`

Now that we have access to SHAP values we can use the `shap` package to
make any plots that we want.

### 5.1 Bar plot

Here, let’s make bar plots for each series and their features, so we can
see which features impacts the predictions the most.

```python
import shap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

shap_columns = shap_df.columns.difference(['unique_id', 'ds', 'TimeGPT', 'base_value'])
shap_values = shap_df[shap_columns].values  # SHAP values matrix
base_values = shap_df['base_value'].values  # Extract base values
features = shap_columns  # Feature names

# Create a SHAP values object
shap_obj = shap.Explanation(values=shap_values, base_values=base_values, feature_names=features)

# Plot the bar plot for SHAP values
shap.plots.bar(shap_obj, max_display=len(features), show=False)
plt.title(f'SHAP values for {market}')
plt.show()
```

![](/nixtla/docs/tutorials/21_shap_values_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-9-output-1.png)

The plot above shows the average SHAP values for each feature across the
entire horizon.

Here, we see that `Exogenous1` is the most important feature, as it has
the largest average contribution. Remember that it designates the
expected energy demand, so we can see that this variable has a large
impact on the final prediction. On the other hand, `day_2` is the least
important feature, since it has the lowest value.

### 5.2 Waterfall plot

Now, let’s see how we can make a waterfall plot to explore the the
impact of features at a single prediction step. The code below selects a
specific date. Of course, this can be modified for any series or date.

```python
selected_ds = shap_df['ds'].min()

filtered_df = shap_df[shap_df['ds'] == selected_ds]

shap_values = filtered_df[shap_columns].values.flatten()
base_value = filtered_df['base_value'].values[0]
features = shap_columns

shap_obj = shap.Explanation(values=shap_values, base_values=base_value, feature_names=features)

shap.plots.waterfall(shap_obj, show=False)
plt.title(f'Waterfall Plot: {market}, date: {selected_ds}')
plt.show()
```

![](/nixtla/docs/tutorials/21_shap_values_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-10-output-1.png)

In the waterfall plot above, we can explore in more detail a single
prediction. Here, we study the final prediction for the start of
December 31th, 2016.

The x-axis represents the value of our series. At the bottom, we see
`E[f(X)]` which represents the baseline value (the predicted value if
exogenous features were unknown).

Then, we see how each feature has impacted the final forecast. Features
like `day_3`, `day_1`, `day_5`, `Exogenous2` all push the forecast to
the left (smaller value). On the other hand, `day_0`, `day_2`, `day_4`,
`day_6` and `Exogenous1` push it to the right (larger value).

Let’s think about this for a moment. In the introduction, we stated that
`Exogenous1` represents electricity load, whereas `Exogenous2`
represents electricity generation. \* `Exogenous1`, the electricity
load, adds positively to the overall prediction. This seems reasonable:
if we expect a higher demand, we might expect the price to go up. \*
`Exogenous2`, on the other hand, adds negatively to the overall
prediction. This seems reasonable too: if there’s a higher electricity
generation, we expect the price to be lower. Hence, a negative
contribution to the forecast for `Exogenous2`.

At the top right, we see f(x) which is the final output of the model
after considering the impact of the exogenous features. Notice that this
value corresponds to the final prediction from TimeGPT.

### 5.3 Heatmap

We can also do a heatmap plot to see how each feature impacts the final
prediction. Here, we only need to select a specific series.

```python
shap_columns = shap_df.columns.difference(['unique_id', 'ds', 'TimeGPT', 'base_value'])
shap_values = shap_df[shap_columns].values  
feature_names = shap_columns.tolist()

shap_obj = shap.Explanation(values=shap_values, feature_names=feature_names)

shap.plots.heatmap(shap_obj, show=False)
plt.title(f'SHAP Heatmap (Unique ID: NP)')
plt.show()
```

![](/nixtla/docs/tutorials/21_shap_values_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-11-output-1.png)

With the heatmap, we basically see a breakdown of each each feature
impacts the final predciton at each timestep.

On the x-axis, we have the number of instances, which corresponds to the
number of prediction steps (24 in this case, since our horizon is set to
24h). On the y-axis, we have the name of the exogenous features.

First, notice that the ordering is the same as in the bar plot, where
`Exogenous1` is the most important, and `day_6` is the least important.

Then, the color of the heatmap indiciates if the feature tends to
increase of decrease the final prediction at each forecasting step. For
example, `Exogenous1` always increases predictions across all 24 hours
in the forecast horizon.

We also see that all days except `day_5` do not have a very large impact
at any forecasting step, indicating that they barely impacting the final
prediction.

Ultimately, the `feature_contributions` attribute gives you access to
all the necessary information to explain the impact of exogenous
features using the `shap` package.
