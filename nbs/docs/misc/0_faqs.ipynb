    "### What is TimeGPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "`TimeGPT` is the first foundation model for time series forecasting. It can produce accurate forecasts for new time series across a diverse array of domains using only historical values as inputs. The model \"reads\" time series data sequentially from left to right, similarly to how humans read a sentence. It looks at windows of past data, which we can think of as \"tokens\", and then predicts what comes next. This prediction is based on patterns the model identifies and that it extrapolates into the future. Beyond forecasting, `TimeGPT` supports other time series related tasks, such as what-if-scenarios, anomaly detection, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Is TimeGPT based on a Large Language Model (LLM)? \n",
    "\n",
    "No, `TimeGPT` is not based on any large language model. While it follows the same principle of training a large transformer model on a vast dataset, its architecture is specifically designed to handle time series data and it has been trained to minimize forecasting errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I get started with TimeGPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with `TimeGPT`, you need to register for an account [here](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/). You will receive an email asking you to confirm your signup. After confirming, you will be able to access your dashboard, which contains the details of your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How accessible is TimeGPT and what are the usage costs?  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a more in-depth understanding of `TimeGPT`, please refer to the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03589.pdf). While certain aspects of the model's architecture remain confidential, registration for `TimeGPT` is open to all. New users receive $1,000 USD in free credits and subsequent usage fees are based on token consumption. For more details, please refer to the [Pricing and Billing](#pricing-and-billing) section\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can I use TimeGPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Through the [Python SDK](https://github.com/Nixtla/nixtla)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Via the `TimeGPT` API. For instructions on how to call the API using different languages, please refer to the [API documentation](https://docs.nixtla.io/reference/timegpt_timegpt_post)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods require you to have a [token](#timegpt-token), which is obtained upon registration and can be found in your dashboard under `API Keys`."

   "source": [
    "### What is a token?\n",
    "\n",
    "A token, also known as an API Key, is a unique string of characters that serves as a key to authenticate your requests when using the Nixtla SDK. It ensures that the person making the requests is authorized to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where can I get a token? \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon registration, you will receive a token that can be found in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/) under `API Keys`. Remember that your token is personal and should not be shared with anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I use my token?\n",
    "\n",
    "To integrate your token into your development workflow, please refer to the tutorial on [Setting Up Your Authentication Token](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/setting_up_your_authentication_token). \n",
    "\n",
    "### How can I check the status of my token?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to check the status of your token, you can use the [`validate_token` method](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/timegpt.html#timegpt-validate-token) of the `TimeGPT` class. "

    "\n",
    "### Can TimeGPT be used to forecast historical data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. To find out how to forecast historical data using `TimeGPT`, see the [Historical Forecast](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/docs/tutorials/historical_forecast.html) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can TimeGPT be used for uncertainty quantification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. For more information, explore the [Prediction Intervals](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/prediction_intervals) and [Quantile Forecasts](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/quantile_forecasts) tutorials. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Can TimeGPT handle large datasets? \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. When dealing with large datasets that contain hundreds of thousands or millions of time series, we recommend using a distributed backend. `TimeGPT` is compatible with several distributed computing frameworks, including [Spark](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/how_to_on_spark_forecasting), Ray, and Fugue. Both the `TimeGPT` SDK and API donâ€™t have a limit on the size of the dataset as long as a distributed backend is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can TimeGPT be used with limited/short data?\n",
    "\n",
    "`TimeGPT` requires at least two seasonal periods of the given frequency to produce accurate forecasts. More may be needed for confidence intervals and for fine-tuning. While `TimeGPT` can work with just one observation, its accuracy will be limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the maximum forecast horizon allowed by TimeGPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "While `TimeGPT` does not have a maximum forecast horizon, its performance will decrease as the horizon increases. For details, refer to the tutorial on [Long Horizon in Time Series](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/long_horizon_in_time_series).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can TimeGPT handle missing values? \n",
    "\n",
    "`TimeGPT` cannot handle missing values or series with irregular timestamps. For more information, see the [Forecasting Time Series with Irregular Timestamps](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/docs/tutorials/irregular_timestamps.html) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can I plot the TimeGPT forecast? \n",
    "\n",
    "The `TimeGPT` class has a [`plot` method](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/timegpt.html#timegpt-plot) that can be used to visualize the forecast. This method only works in interactive environments such as Jupyter notebooks and it doesn't work on Python scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Does TimeGPT support polars? \n",
    "\n",
    "As of now, `TimeGPT` supports only pandas DataFrames and does not offer support for polars. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Does TimeGPT produce stable predictions? \n",
    "\n",
    "`TimeGPT` is engineered for stability, ensuring consistent results for identical input data. This means that given the same dataset, the model will produce the same forecasts."

    "### What is fine-tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "`TimeGPT` was trained on the largest publicly available time series dataset, covering a wide range of domains such as finance, retail, healthcare, and more. This comprehensive training enables `TimeGPT` to produce accurate forecasts for new time series without additional training, a capability known as zero-shot learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While the zero-shot model provides a solid baseline, the performance of `TimeGPT` can often be improved through fine-tuning. During this process, the `TimeGPT` model undergoes additional training using your specific dataset, starting from the pre-trained paramaters. The updated model then produces the forecasts. You can control the number of training iterations and the loss function for fine-tuning with the `finetune_steps` and the `finetune_loss` parameters in the `forecast` method from the `TimeGPT` class, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a comprehensive guide on how to apply fine-tuning, please refer to the [fine-tuning](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/finetuning) and the [fine-tuning with a specific loss function](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/fine_tuning_with_a_specific_loss_function) tutorials. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Do I have to fine-tune every series? \n",
    "\n",
    "No, you do not need to fine-tune every series individually. When using the `finetune_steps` parameter, the model undergoes fine-tuning across all series in your dataset simultaneously. This method uses a cross-learning approach, allowing the model to learn from multiple series at once, which can improve individual forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that selecting the right number of fine-tuning steps may require some trial and error. As the number of fine-tuning steps increases, the model becomes more specialized to your dataset, but will take longer to train and may be more prone to overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Can I save fine-tuned parameters? \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, it is not possible to save the fine-tuned parameters for later use. This means you will need to perform fine-tuning each time you submit your data, whether using the Python SDK or the API."
