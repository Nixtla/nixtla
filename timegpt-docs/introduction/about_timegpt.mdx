  <Step title="2. Choose Your Interface">
    You can access TimeGPT through:

      -
        [Azure Studio (TimeGEN-1)](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/deployment-azureai)


      - Public APIs

      - Private deployment on your own infrastructure


  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Upload Time Series Data">
    Provide your time series data. TimeGPT can consume data with irregular timestamps, exogenous variables, or multiple time series simultaneously.
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Forecast or Detect Anomalies">
    Perform zero-shot inference out-of-the-box to forecast future values or detect anomalies. Fine-tune the model if you need more targeted performance.

## Architecture

<Frame caption="TimeGPT Architecture Overview">
  ![TimeGPT Architecture Overview](https://github.com/Nixtla/nixtla/blob/main/nbs/img/timegpt_archi.png?raw=true)
</Frame>

TimeGPT's architecture builds on the self-attention mechanism introduced in the original ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper. Unlike typical large language models (LLMs), TimeGPT is independently trained on extensive time series datasets to minimize forecasting errors.

<Info>
TimeGPT employs an encoder-decoder structure with residual connections, layer normalization, and a linear output layer to match the decoder outputs to forecast dimensions. The attention-based mechanisms help the model capture diverse historical patterns to create accurate future predictions.
</Info>

The model processes input sequences from left to right, similar to how humans read sentences, and predicts future values (*"tokens"*) based on historical windows of time series data.
