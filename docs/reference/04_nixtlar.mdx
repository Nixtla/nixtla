title: TimeGPT in R
---

TimeGPT is also available in R through the `nixtlar` package, which is
available on CRAN. This package can be used in a way almost identical to
its Python counterpart. It offers nearly the same functionalities, with
missing features and documentation currently under development.
Originally developed in Python, TimeGPT is now accessible to the R
community through `nixtlar`, providing access to the first foundation
model for time series forecasting and embracing our core philosophy that
*the future is for everybody*.
