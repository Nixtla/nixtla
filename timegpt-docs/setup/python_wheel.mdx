Using TimeGPT through API calls might not be the optimal solution for your organization, as it implies sending data to external servers.

One way of respecting data security requirements is to use a Python wheel.

We can send you a custom Python wheel for your own needs, allowing you to locally install TimeGPT. That way, you can make forecasts and perform anomaly detection locally, without the need of a server.

Benefits of using a Python wheel include:
- Local installation so there is no need of a dedicated server
- Lower latency as there is no data transfer
- Data is secure as it never leaves your local machine

The Python wheel is available for enterprise clients. To request access via a Python wheel, [book a call with us](https://meetings.hubspot.com/cristian-challu/enterprise-contact-us?uuid=7a3723cd-153e-4901-a81c-f6cee9d6a6a3&utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=setup-docs&utm_campaign=python-wheel-timegpt).

Once access is granted, we will send a Python wheel as well as all the necessary instructions to install and use TimeGPT locally.
