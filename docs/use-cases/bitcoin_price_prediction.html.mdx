## Introduction

Forecasting time series is a ubiquitous task in finance, supporting
decisions in trading, risk management, and strategic planning. Despite
its prevalence, predicting the future prices of financial assets remains
a formidable challenge, mainly due to the inherent volatility of
financial markets.

For those who believe in the feasibility of forecasting these assets, or
for professionals whose roles require such predictions, TimeGPT is a
powerful tool that simplifies the forecasting process.

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use TimeGPT for financial
time series forecasting, focusing on Bitcoin price prediction. We will
also showcase how to use TimeGPT for uncertainty quantification, which
is essential for risk management and decision-making.

## 1. Load Bitcoin Price Data

Bitcoin (₿) is the first decentralized digital currency and is one of
the most popular cryptocurrencies. Transactions are managed and recorded
on a public ledger known as the blockchain. Bitcoins are created as a
reward for mining, a process that involves solving complex cryptographic
tasks to verify transactions. This digital currency can be used as
payment for goods and services, traded for other currencies, or held as
a store of value.

In this tutorial, we will first download the historical Bitcoin price
data in USD as a `pandas` DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd 

df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/main/datasets/bitcoin_price_usd.csv', sep=',')  
df.head()
```

|     | Date       | Close       |
|-----|------------|-------------|
| 0   | 2020-01-01 | 7200.174316 |
| 1   | 2020-01-02 | 6985.470215 |
| 2   | 2020-01-03 | 7344.884277 |
| 3   | 2020-01-04 | 7410.656738 |
| 4   | 2020-01-05 | 7411.317383 |

This dataset contains the closing price of Bitcoin in USD from
2020-01-01 to 2023-12-31. It’s important to note that unlike traditional
financial assets, Bitcoin trades 24/7. Therefore, the closing price
represents the price of Bitcoin at a specific time each day, rather than
at the end of a trading day.

For convenience, we will rename the `Date` and `Close` columns to `ds`
and `y`, respectively.

```python
df.rename(columns={'Date': 'ds', 'Close': 'y'}, inplace=True)
```

## 2. Get Started with TimeGPT

To get started with `TimeGPT`, you need to instantiate the
[`NixtlaClient`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient)
class. For this, you will need a Nixtla API key.

```python
from nixtla import NixtlaClient
```


```python
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(
    # defaults to os.environ.get("NIXTLA_API_KEY")
    api_key = 'my_api_key_provided_by_nixtla'
)
```

> 👍 Use an Azure AI endpoint
>
> To use an Azure AI endpoint, remember to set also the `base_url`
> argument:
>
> `nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(base_url="you azure ai endpoint", api_key="your api_key")`

To learn more about how to set up your API key, please refer to the
[Setting Up Your Authentication API
Key](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/getting-started-setting_up_your_api_key)
tutorial.

## 3. Visualize the Data

Before attempting any forecasting, it is good practice to visualize the
data we want to predict. The
[`NixtlaClient`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient)
class includes a `plot` method for this purpose.

The `plot` method has an `engine` argument that allows you to choose
between different plotting libraries. Default is `matplotlib`, but you
can also use `plotly` for interactive plots.

```python
nixtla_client.plot(df)
```

![](/nixtla/docs/use-cases/2_bitcoin_price_prediction_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-7-output-1.png)

If you haven’t renamed the column names of your DataFrame to `ds` and
`y`, you will need to specify the `time_col` and `target_col` arguments
of the `plot`method:

```python
nixtla_client.plot(df, time_col='name of your time column', target_col='name of your target column')
```

This is necessary not only for the `plot` method but for all methods
from the
[`NixtlaClient`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient)
class.

## 4. Forecast with TimeGPT

Now we are ready to generate predictions with TimeGPT. To do this, we
will use the `forecast` method from the
[`NixtlaClient`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient)
class.

The `forecast` method requires the following arguments:

-   `df`: The DataFrame containing the time series data

-   `h`: (int) The forecast horizon. In this case, we will forecast the
    next 7 days.

-   `level`: (list) The confidence level for the prediction intervals.
    Given the inherent volatility of Bitcoin, we will use multiple
    confidence levels.

```python
level = [50,80,90] # confidence levels 

fcst = nixtla_client.forecast(df, h=7, level=level)
fcst.head()
```

We can pass the forecasts we just generated to the `plot` method to
visualize the predictions with the historical data.

```python
nixtla_client.plot(df, fcst, level=level)
```

![](/nixtla/docs/use-cases/2_bitcoin_price_prediction_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-9-output-1.png)

To get a closer look at the predictions, we can zoom in on the plot or
specify the maximum number of in-sample observations to be plotted using
the `max_insample_length` argument. Note that setting
`max_insample_length=60`, for instance, will display the last 60
historical values along with the complete forecast.

```python
nixtla_client.plot(df, fcst, level=level, max_insample_length=60)
```

![](/nixtla/docs/use-cases/2_bitcoin_price_prediction_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-10-output-1.png)

Additionally, if you set the `add_history` argument of the `forecast`
method to `True`, `TimeGPT` will generate predictions for the historical
observations too. This can be useful for assessing the model’s
performance on the training data.

```python
forecast = nixtla_client.forecast(df, h=7, level=level, add_history=True)
forecast.head()
```

## 5. Extend Bitcoin Price Analysis with TimeGPT

### Anomaly Detection

Given the volatility of the price of Bitcoin, it can be useful to try to
identify anomalies in the data. `TimeGPT` can be used for this by
calling the `detect_anomalies` method from the
[`NixtlaClient`](https://Nixtla.github.io/nixtla/src/nixtla_client.html#nixtlaclient)
class. This method evaluates each observation against its context within
the series, using statistical measures to determine its likelihood of
being an anomaly. By default, it identifies anomalies based on a 99
percent prediction interval. To change this, you can specify the `level`
argument.

```python
anomalies_df = nixtla_client.detect_anomalies(df)
```

``` text
INFO:nixtla.nixtla_client:Validating inputs...
INFO:nixtla.nixtla_client:Preprocessing dataframes...
INFO:nixtla.nixtla_client:Inferred freq: D

```

```

To learn more about how to detect anomalies with `TimeGPT`, take a look
at our [Anomaly
Detection](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/capabilities-anomaly-detection-anomaly_detection)
tutorial.

### Add Exogenous Variables

If you have additional information that you believe could help improve
the forecast, consider including it as an exogenous variable. For
instance, you might add data such as the price of other
cryptocurrencies, proprietary information, stock market indices, or the
number of transactions in the Bitcoin network.

`TimeGPT` supports the incorporation of exogenous variables in the
`forecast` method. However, keep in mind that you’ll need to know the
future values of these variables.

To learn how to incorporate exogenous variables to `TimeGPT`, refer to
the [Exogenous
Variables](https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-exogenous_variables)
tutorial.

## 6. Understand the Model’s Limitations

As stated in the introduction, predicting the future prices of financial
assets is a challenging task, especially for assets like Bitcoin. The
predictions in this tutorial may appear accurate, mainly because they
align with recent historical data and the model updates with new values
at short intervals, avoiding significant deviations. However, the true
challenge lies in forecasting Bitcoin’s price for the upcoming days, not
just its historical performance. For those who need or want to try to
forecast these assets, `TimeGPT` can be an option that simplifies the
forecasting process. With just a couple of lines of code, `TimeGPT` can
help you:

-   Produce point forecasts
-   Quantify the uncertainty of your predictions
-   Produce in-sample forecasts
-   Detect anomalies
-   Incorporate exogenous variables

To learn more about `TimeGPT` capabilities, please refer to the [TimeGPT
Documentation](https://docs.nixtla.io/).

Furthermore, for many financial time series, the best estimate for the
price is often a random walk model, meaning that the best forecast for
tomorrow’s price is today’s price. Nixtla’s

library allows you to easily implement this model and variations.
